125337	You’re crazy. The 2nd half adjustments that put them back in the game is why they belonged in the game.	2
99611	I hope last night was fun enough to warrant the hassle today.	20
192432	How will identity politics help this situation?	6
145793	Thank you for the context. Everything makes sense now, I'd forgotten how... Certain kinds of people can be	15
17517	Are you looking for clear blocks of ice or just plain blocks?	27
198125	Ok what deal would you like to see made?	7
106286	Don't you know that kids need constant supervision until they turn 18? Or maybe 30. Heaven forbid they walk/bike/bus/etc to school on their own.	2
167712	Population control in russia	27
4829	>I'm 8 years old in human years yeah, I'd bet	0
19031	[NAME] was pretty dumb in s7	9
95879	She looks like a crackhead.	10
181707	I don't think I *ever* rewatched a YouTube video before I discovered LeftTube.	10
156575	“she’s turned the weeans against us!”	2
2362	That's quite an arrangement	4
2044	Yeah you better hope. I just switched to combat pro from standard and I gotta say my builds are 🗿	4
206676	Lol! I’m glad you feel lucky because you are! Could you imagine dealing with the continuous flipping back and forth between desire and guilt? 😬	27
86700	32nd? It felt like 99th or something...	6
167756	What are you on about man, those are just rollerblades for fancy occasions 	27
152464	The slam final I want, [NAME] vs [NAME]. The slam final we'll get, [NAME] vs [NAME].	9
23068	I'm glad it helps, best of luck on your journey. You've gone 7 days clean, keep doing what makes you clean for 84 more!	15
194639	So we're the 2nd richest team.	17
63237	Holy fuck, no wonder the turtle beat the hare	27
1252	He wasn't beat over the top all season. I think the longest pass he allowed was around 20 yards.	27
107387	This. It seems he's undoubtedly [NAME] preferred option.	19
92898	Nah, share it then down vote it in to oblivion.	4
132670	Thanks, do we know how this document has been publicised, and if it's not a fake document 	15
62902	Welcome to the gloaming. Yes.	15
63347	I couldnt help but laugh out loud. Pure stupidity coming from the mother. No other way to put it	27
39351	These shows are scripted	27
206780	Hahaha for real..	1
75333	Already have one of those, mate :) just looking for a good replacement so I can continue using my [NAME]	13
128952	I like Abram wayyyy more that Rapp. I hope we can snag Abram so we can use our first two picks to fill other holes.	0
7158	That’s what I said.	27
120198	Hell yeah, high five. Good job!	0
126512	this ain’t it cheeeifffff. love is love, don’t matter who’s on the receiving end	27
153845	I also posted about this a few days ago. Maybe they have different designers but none of them has follow-up or approval from a single person, unfortunate	9
146622	[NAME] done fucked up.	2
189575	kinda obviously satire op	22
159949	we can move on when you answer the questions that i have for you are you ready to do that?	27
157305	Hope your mum gets well soon. Enjoy Saturday!	17
34127	I'd say no, mostly because you don't plan to stay long-term.	10
87537	take care!! <3	5
120407	What she is doing is child abuse, plain and simple. Fight with everything you have to protect your kids. 	2
86370	Man. Just tuned in. Forgot it was an early game. Looks like it's been a positive game so far from pretty much everyone.	27
101038	Mother of [NAME]... Im not grossed out very easily. I can stomach just about anything. But this made my fucking skin crawl....	27
57860	Hhhhhaaarrryyy [NAME]!	27
94234	Who fucking cares. People have sex all the time. You're just an asshole for trying to to profit from it or ruin her.	2
185207	Damn for that much you may as well use a mobile plan unless you're doing something latency sensitive.	20
121381	That’s horrible. Only religion could make an otherwise normal person want to show a torture and murder video to a child.	2
195579	Yes, is there any way we can do this? Cos fuck that POS.	2
111014	Armenian elves are known for their thick skin and mouth-breathing. This one seems stoned, I’d stay away from it.	3
203163	My dad also told me the car went underwater the first time we went to the Eastern Shore and I completely forgot about it until I read this comment.	27
40108	[NAME] is playing with so much energy today. New year, new haircut, maybe he's feeling like it's an opportunity for a fresh start. 	20
92751	Is it any different to the poorer suburbs out west? I feel like it's only noticed because it's so close to the city.	7
6942	Go away [NAME]....	2
12807	I just want tk be a random scumbag	8
183884	Absolutely nothing! LOL	1
74620	I mean I'd rather have play him in the infield, but either way someone will get injured and [NAME] will play the infield.	27
88213	That's... pretty unexpected actually.	22
147473	Wishing the best for your pupper.	0
135847	Gotcha. I'll do a little Google-fu and see what comes up. Thanks anyway!	15
23147	I can't help it. It's just so perfect.	4
186952	>It's for this reason I'm hoping to leave. Where to if you don't mind me asking?	27

38110	That's too many pills	2
26267	I feel ya.	4
77053	I’m in my second year. Still closeted. Still uncomfortable with my body and sexuality. Still socially awkward.	12
51960	You're just mad because you're starting to realize that you're reaaaaaaaaaaally close to being a [NAME].	2
129274	Omg I could cry at this	26
7297	You’re right, republicans are worse because they have nukes.	11
54143	Disagree wholeheartedly. I'm actually amazed anyone can think this way.	10
25476	I am really excited for you! We texted a few weeks before we met too! The first hugs and kisses were the best!	13
125851	"I live in australia and even aussies say ""cook the man some eggs"" as a joke to kiwis"	1
196242	And it needs to keep pushing harder and harder to the left in order to wash away all the crap that's been enacted since [NAME] got into office.	3
71568	Oh, with that title I thought the crocodile was gonna- oh.	27
4579	Police numbers in London are at their lowest (per head of population) in twenty years. Those fucking cuts!	2
118899	We’ve done this twice, we have four awesome trees from them. Awesome organization!	0
178388	Dashy gunless apathy arcitys scump	27
144107	For those behind stupid WaPo	3
181417	Is [NAME] up to his neck is dodgy dealings again after RHI?	27
196102	They should prank their customers by having someone act out being given a colombian neck tie while getting a shave.	8
119272	I remember that one! She was so proud of herself for all the organization and I just felt bad for the kids.	27
11276	[NAME] this makes me feel ancient.	26
132232	Every one hates him so your just bragging you hate him too to be cool . Its not a confession unless u say something u regret	10
113508	Also “he wasn’t even good enough to be a starting pitcher how could i possibly allow him to be the first unanimous HOFer”	27
121975	Because it's scary, and therefore thrilling to face your fear. Also the shrimp are easier to catch at night.	14
73357	So glad you got justice and closure. You can properly begin to heal now. I’m not sure I ever will get the same sadly	23
129477	I love Wayfair! Just started using them and am impressed. Sounds like UPS sucks. Enjoy your couches! Haha	1
70309	Oh [NAME] why does he have to drag green day into this	3
79273	Whats wrong with removing illegal immigrants?	7
7066	Exactly hate when people try to spit facts when they don’t know if those facts are even right😂😂	2
180671	Looks like your typical blurry picture to me, but I’m no doctor.	27
77730	Your insurance rates went up because they. Aw hell...like it makes any differencd	27
75519	This argument makes zero sense. The same tax exclusions and exemptions that were around when the marginal rate was at 90 are not around today.	10
76064	You have to be trolling because I doubt you’re this dumb.	6
38934	False, if I'm close to the cart return I can't run and ride the cart back to the return. Lol	10
17215	Because they think the govt should provide all the jobs, they're crazy. 	25
94110	It's easy to overthink things online, I'm glad you gave him a chance.	5
169430	Couldn’t agree more	4
33015	I personally wouldn't have best offer on and free shipping, customers will always always put a lower offer and you have to cover postage too. 	27
103100	I'd love him to get a pick6/scoop and score and chief slam on them	17
198991	[NAME], thank you, for being a friend.	15
111767	It's always been a dodgy road, proposals were put in ages ago	27
192660	Actually good point, I should have asked for the source their too. It was only a rumor when I first heard. Might be wrong, sorry.	4
87673	Wow, this is terrifying.	14
93500	Why don’t people just call the cops and give them the video?	3
131545	Idk why this is downvoted. Sounds like they were asking a legitimate question and was truly curious.	6
132955	I like [NAME] as a person I just don’t want to see or hear any sexy times between her and [NAME].	25
29060	Im sorry that I'm only able to give a single upvote for this wonderful, graphic, and accurate visualization.	9
71953	so you can't state it definitively, therefore you think it's a possibility so i was right all along. i thought so	27
27732	As far as I know, she offered quick snack to all of them, just out of obligation and two of them accepted that.	3
134899	Pushit...always	27
122954	01/11/19 - pretty easy to remember as it is the day my band released it's first full length record. The release day gig was also pretty neat!	27
143384	Dude got owned by a glass of cider. He spent a full month roiling and gnashing his teeth in an existential nightmare because of sulphites.	27
44104	I actually rooted for you guys that Seahawks game, but now I feel the true pain. 	25
138236	He thought of it but we don't want his mother's house to be wrecked by the staff.	2
63743	England is all about driver safety. Competence...well....	5
91285	Makes my skin crawl	17
7982	Shut up and stop trolling. You're not funny	2
25455	I know, I know, but CAN YOU BLAME ME FOR BEING NERVOUS	14
46366	How random. I did that just riding around town for no reason and saw that lighting.	17
166863	Can’t believe [NAME] era is coming to an end... feels like yesterday I saw his 1st win against the cowboys with tiki breaking the rushing record.	25
991	Not everybody can grow their own or even wants to.	27
110235	I’m having a counseling this weekend ... nothing to be scared.... just tell them about your feelings and what are you worrying about..	5
167095	If he was from a free pack he's not sellable, sorry	24
68248	Yeah they are! I didn't realize that, it must be the case. Thanks!	10
47868	I guess Metric is old enough now for one of their songs to be Grey’s title. Huh.	27
41259	I draw with a wacom tablet, and I want to be an animator, maybe some game stuff down the line	8
132854	Funny bc random guys do that behind girls in clubs sometimes.	1
172323	Most athletic play [NAME] ever made. Wow	13
39276	I've eaten some really strange stuff and the only reason to eat this is to see if it is gross.	11
175142	In my few years playing I never knew this ... I feel so lost now	25
177321	Who are these outraged [NAME] women?!	6
185703	Only 2 days ?	7
205256	The foul, smelly dump I just took > fallout 76	11
166487	Awh you're hurt	26

34629	Oh you're MGTOW. Lmao.	1
209951	nothing specific. it varies. it's rare.	27
126403	Nice try, but the only person this sub dislikes more than [NAME] is the [NAME].	3
125888	You’ll just be throwing them up. Ain’t worth it.	10
95731	That's really interesting! I've seen that happen before too	26
30895	weird how they feel the need to announce themselves	27
49087	Lmao the UBI is just the powers that be making sure they don't have a revolt on their hands once their program of economic alienation reaches a head.	27
169622	My coworkers mood rn. Sober AF.	27
91263	He should just give it to you right?	27
144151	Hi [NAME]. Nice to meet you, I'm promet. 	13
37881	This guy also has scorching speed on the bases.	27
21462	"I wake up in a cold sweat at four am on a Tuesday like ""table twelve never got their ranch three Fridays ago"" "	14
56351	They can't they need a morty dumbness shield	9
116990	Posting someone elses camp on reddit? Really? haha.	1

151309	Like all mavs fans... [NAME] its not a rookie anymore xD	27
175343	Damn, sounds like I missed a few things, I might need to rewatch the first season!	27
130503	"Lol thanks, yeah you need to ""legitimize"" the being hacked part and build from there. "	15
71050	Wow misleading title.. Ffs	0
195834	Dump her. Shes not committed to you	2
166822	I love being down by 10+ constantly.... I feel like [NAME] gets dominated by literally everyone.	18
209932	thank god your not on the dev team	23
193963	Ah, thought they made another FA character cannon for a minute. I'd like to see [NAME] come back (with a bit of a nerf:)	27
63773	You are definently not in the wrong because you didnt actually him. Also does your brother get any special privledges that you dont?	27
207694	cool, I never said anything about communism, that's a pretty wild non-sequitur 	3
104339	pretty much correct except for when right wingers get triggered they type on a keyboard and when leftists get triggered they try and ruin the career of whatever offended them	0
91514	What a useless answer in this situation	10
159079	Oh, I mean I guess he’ll run if he loses. But do you think he will run if he wins? 	7

160602	From my experience minoxidil only stops loss, unfortunately it doesn't encourage new growth	10
125522	Grow up.	27
11536	No, no I'm not.	27
200525	If the anime really ends that way there’s no way I see [NAME] and [NAME] get back together.	27

127846	muh racist history! its all gone! no one will ever know about my slavery and being a traitorous vermin! help meh!	18
17884	Anyone here know what kind of rifle he's carrying? Looks like an Israeli Galil but I'm not sure.	10

123092	You are an absolute gem	15
63035	This definitely was what I was thinking too. With the things that go on nowadays, I wouldnt be suprised!	8

5711	How poignant.	6
157359	I really hope not. I want a more feel good intermission, I’m done with being yelled at by angry old conservatives. 	3
80058	I'm thinking he ment [NAME] but he's still a karma stealing whore.	27
65762	Your both right and I'd rather have the drink than a rynair flight !	4
115611	StS and Thronebreaker are both singeplayer. Comparing them with Artifact is disingenuous.	9

107902	It's still interesting to watch though ... from far away, with no personal involvement whatsoever.	0

180460	I truly hope so	27
129229	You have nothing to feel bad about. It sounds like he needs to grow up and start paying his way.	5

36679	Comedycemetery? More like repostcemetery	1
138361	I met up with a woman who was 49. She reminded me of being old. That isn't attractive. Youth makes you feel alive.	9

60975	Putting on head phones with a neutral song	4
88659	No it's propaganda we because r/politics only presents info, true or (usually) or otherwise info that is designed to hurts conservatives and help liberals. Propaganda	9
71722	Ok, so you're not actually going to rebut anything. Good night.	6

166989	Where is the problem? **Just do it again!**	0
12746	I think everyone should watch the first season. It's hilarious, but also a pretty brutal indictment about what a show politics is.	1
94254	I think the teacher was right though. Money would make a terrible aggregate.	20
90897	are they worried their dog will get autism or something?	5
158408	Do you want a good time or an **incredibilis** time?	7

125880	I laughed.	1
125859	Holy shit. Amazing response.	0

145663	They're a clear example of what can go wrong when you marry ANYONE you don't really know, regardless of where they're from.	4
26754	I'm very sorry for u, they should treat you like royalty not a fleshlight	9

165617	congrats, [NAME]. you played yourself	0
171250	I pray to [NAME] that we will be aware of people's sins in the afterlife when we watch them burn.	20

63431	"Without Googling it? Are you kidding? (Please don't look up ""kidding"" in the dictionary.)"	2
18356	One elite run stopper please thanks	15
169975	Doesn’t... doesn’t it take more time and work forging a signature and lying than just.. delivering the package at the front door?	7
130272	I cant decide if replacing it with an icecream cone would make it better or worse or incredibly worse and also cursed	6
176989	RemindME! 3 months	27

169559	[NAME], “How dare you show concern for the wounded!” Made me chuckle.	13
86685	Thank you very much. I would certainly make a note of your name.	15
104821	Honestly, an obvious possibility is you find the men who you are banging other than him to be more attractive. 	18
43290	Man it’s easy to cut your wiener off. Easy!	27
182181	This is from ralph lauren? [NAME], someone put their designer out of their misery.	27

156917	How are you doing man? I mean, what's up in your life right now? You seem really miserable tbh.	27
208571	Was almost hit by some idiot yesterday that drove straight through a red light and into a crossing.	10
188199	Every day in everyway. If I am to happy with anything next thing I know I'm actively destroying it.	9
23717	It looks like a very light blue to me.	27
23478	Interesting. See, that seems much more adult. And actually makes sense. The things we do in the US man...	4
66049	I keep being drawn to her privates because it looks so strange to me.	22
98655	It’s oddly unsatisfying when someone beats me to saying that.	9
171154	So police were banned from having holidays, not police banned everyone else from having holidays	27
87316	Maybe it's as dangerous for [NAME] to whip people up talking about treason and betrayal and all that as it is when [NAME] do it. Fancy that.	27
35860	Yeah you're right. That's the problem. Not guys thinking it's ok to message someone they haven't matched with outside of Tinder.	4
170821	[NAME] and his supporters are the dumbest humans in the fucking galaxy. They should be locked up for their own safety.	2
15340	I knew the top comment *had to be* about them fonts.	22
127406	That's how you think hes trying to input something. Glad it was my way home.	23

174172	Heh I love this.	13

61124	The new live-action movie looks great!	0

147417	Bye that's it for me. I'ts all over.	10
76701	I’m guessing you don’t take bad news lightly. I’m sorry bud :/	10
67083	Discuss and follow a case an onsessibg per the case are different. It's odd. It's the only conviction on earth where we see this.	10
193779	The EU delusion:why a utopian project was always doomed to failure.	7
31686	I wake up and think I have to go to school and then realize I've graduated and I'm going to work	22

108115	[NAME] people. Just vaccinate your overgrown sperm cells and people won't have to die.	27
156100	 Therapy really is the only way. It's not easy, but maybe therapy will help you learn to love yourself enough to love someone else one day. 	18
189031	I’ve tried a few times on mobile and it never works for some reason. Edit: just logged on at work and fixed it. Feels good	4
105201	Or finishing in 91 minutes and sitting there for another half hour, bursting for a piss	27
27709	Nobody expects you to finish the 10 string.	27
111276	I thought that said affordable, and i was really concerned	5
9209	British would annoy me more. Or being called British Isles	27
133744	I had a choice between him and obj at 6 overall and I’m glad I went with [NAME]	4
36548	She's going to OD without a clue the first time she's introduced to Avocado & toast...	27

162657	That took a turn.	27
185465	... and no one seemed to care Except that lonely woman with white hair	5
131994	All the smut at Target makes me cringe. That, and the very clearly politically-charged children's books.	27
173013	Yes what the fuck is going on here	6
197279	Work on your anxiety and self-esteem. Do things for YOU. Love yourself.	17
19676	Man, never underestimate the power of a crock pot, some frozen chicken, veggies and cottage cheese.	9
36038	Hahaha that’s amazing. Good for you	0
159360	Hard to describe, but I get a more relaxed sleep with cbd.	17
173865	Every day it gets harder to tell the difference between a legit mental health issue and someone just using it as an excuse to be an arsehole.	10
76016	Listen carefully and watch me wink as I speak. The guy I'm really looking for, *wink*, is Mr. [NAME], *wink wink*.	27
50094	I’m seeing ‘bad gateway’, not the maintenance page. 	10
203307	Frozen berries are fantastic. Put a few in some heavy whipping cream in a blender with a little sweetener.	0
31668	also that fiat (if paid in Bolivares) will quickly depreciate in a week	3
112039	Was really hoping he’d drive off with it (sigh)	20
61519	The problem is I have no clue where he stands as he’s so far on her side.	27
112226	[NAME] loves you. If you are a [NAME] then he forgives you. I like this by [NAME]	20
14694	Same. You all tried to save me, but I rewatched with the sound on and... I have regrets.	24
98092	I’m okay with the “expecting mother’s” spots. It’s not a women thing, it’s a courtesy thing 	4
127673	[NAME] is cheaper too. If we would have kept [NAME] we would have had to extend him to over $4mil.	27
171167	Thank you.	15
106914	oh my [NAME] is this real	26
113358	No Mayo No Care.	3

28367	Can anyone share the attitude of the madinans towards [NAME] when he went there?	7
131008	Thank you! It will help a lot	15
129051	4-6, 6-4, 3-all, deuce. Could this BE any closer?	20
20060	Which is exactly the point capt obvious.	27
110866	Boston sports doesn’t deserve anymore titles, fuck the pats	3
174195	Don't be afraid to go through therapy.	5
56902	Pfft. That's awful of him and her. They deserve each other then. Grab your shite and gtfo. Hope he enjoys his fog and dysfunction.	2
139214	Yes, that's what I'm confused about. Playing RE5 solo.	6
75528	At least she can't use the old thyroid problems excuse for her fatness	27
32799	Especially mean! I’m with you. I like the funny posts but people use social media as an excuse to just be horrible people	2
4041	Sometimes the mouse attacks the snake ! I think you should start dating if he is going to be a asshat.	27
168735	No I actually really like that I don’t have to pump my own gas.	22
145379	I didn't know that he did. Just Googled it. Dope!	27
81018	You can read online if you want. I don't recommend it, but you can.	27
61650	I watch it every time I see it posted. There's something beautiful about watching someone so passionate and excited about what they've discovered :)	4
175351	I agreed with your comment until you told people they shouldn’t be parents for not knowing the difference between deodorant and antiperspirant.	4
2161	make me HmmMhMmM in my pants	27
131500	We thought he was getting better but then he turned himself around.	27

183645	Ouch. Rough year for the jags. Where upstate are you?	4
108629	If you use one of those two I automatically hate you	2
124036	Have you received any answers from them outside of ‘DM me your client ID’ and ‘please make a support ticket’?	7
114228	That ice is dangerously thin for such a hot take.	14
208675	You dont need elected officials to have power when you have the people on your side.	10
73001	I dont really know, I think its mostly because they just get these really high end computers and do nothing with them.	10
189954	"That's a nice way to say ""being forcibly removed as illegal immigrants.""."	4
67258	On this sub I don't know whether to upvote or downvote	3
111520	I can't help but agree with the headline at the bottom, bright side (the YouTube channel) is annoying.	4
141792	Don't cry for me, Argentina.	16
59609	Bedside Rounds (which that user puts out) is also a very interesting podcast on medical history.	4
159824	This right here is the kind of father I want to be. Thanks for that.	8
10273	Wow, I just googled it and holy shizz that's an insane difference.	13
33605	[NAME] plays a character called [NAME] (but is called [NAME]) , not [NAME]. edit: typo	27
28434	In 5 days bones would not be crusted over,sorry not buying it.	25
204797	Are you serious?	7
134289	I feel the guy did this only to correct his mistake and to pretend it never happened.	22
164587	An uproar would be an escalation of his behavior and if he starts stalking me in real life or making threats.	27
62956	Women don't want their own shit. They want our shit. ---- [NAME]	27
19570	Nae wonder they're skint if the pitch is made of Asda bags, 5p a pop isn't to be sniffed at. Adds up that.	0
44991	You’re your own worst enemy	2
76311	You should be proud. I hope that I'll have the will to keep myself held to such a standard when the time comes.	0
204202	[NAME], what? Why are you even here. Fuck off.	2
24602	Seriously, I’ve been catching and loving this one since it first came out.	4
142144	What does Clemson give pride stickers for? Snaps played?	2
182397	Stupid [NAME] referencing that stupid seagull/cricket myth	10

136871	[NAME] black?	7
131787	"He ran as a [NAME] in the Senate primary and then declined the nomination. Multiple times. He isn't ""honoring"" shit."	4
173856	you obviously dont know how the wilpons work lol	1
11326	Your desperate attempts to pretend that this is nothing are...really weird, to be totally honest.	27
52845	Yep never understand why just because a move is small that makes it bad?	10
203852	I get hard in the morning from just standing up and my body not knowing where to put the blood. But any other time of day its always sexual	6
108178	Honestly this would fall significantly more in their capabilities of being witnesses from an Orthodox standard TBH	21
67521	He helped him up. And [NAME] walked back, mad at himself for falling for it	5
174111	Wrong on so many levels. Just sit back and watch it implode. It will hurt at first, but guarantee, you will have the last laugh. 	4
10104	Well it does appear to be a gold/bronze Cadillac. And I think I see a flat bill in the front seat.	6
110856	You take that back right now! [NAME] does not deserve this.	27
63599	Stick your -isms up your ass.	2
77425	I upvoted, even though phrasing make this sentence debatable.	27
192047	Dat trigger discipline though	27
76152	Damn it, karen	2
205343	From what I understand it's effectively an authoritarian state right now.	4
28353	Go Pack from RVA!	27
70717	Might do that, thank you!	15
175685	You d be surprised how “ 3rd”world slum people treat differently abled people	27
49149	Oh [NAME]. someone finally posted something I can't bring myself to finish reading, it's too much	26
177560	I have trouble even remembering what true happiness feels like	25
58250	READ A BOOK YOU FUCKING CROOK.	2
95736	Weirdly I never heard of this show till I saw it on the RTE player this morning, and now this post... Maybe its a sign? 	3
156696	But if the dentist makes you wait more than 15 minutes, you are legally allowed to leave. ^I'm ^just ^kidding, ^you ^probably ^should ^stay.	1
53987	You do, you forget it all & bam something reminds you and it all comes screaming back. Breathe in truth, breathe out bullsh...	22
135370	What’s also interesting is that the artist placed the sun right where the building’s exterior light is located, so the sun really shines.	0
21405	oohh, that makes a lot more sense now, thank you kindly	15
130288	I keep a GF board at all times under my station just for you guys. We probably do 1k+ in GF sales every day.	27
106718	Hmmm, mildly interesting :)	13
175834	Stop with this revisionist history we literally just let him go because HE SUCKED	10
177483	I love to watch [NAME] play tbh	18
15755	> its just there to make people uncomfortable and force a tip. No one working there really expects a tip in the first place.	27
121897	aight guess the refs didn't choose us this game [NAME]	10
105562	*blinded by the shill* I know like 2 people unfortunately..	25
198513	Lol I’m sorry for your dogs ears	12
39609	I didn’t really need those 25 minutes of my life anyway	3
141649	Third here. Oh, ok. Wow.	27
36697	thank you!!	15
15667	That could be the biggest I've seen.	27
199235	Either that, or his wife is *really* attractive. 	1
125908	Lol I learned how to train on the app no joke	1
178757	No I know. This group has been mostly helpful. And the rude comments were deleted by the mods.	4
198856	i like that she's just kind of meeting people and dating. I wouldn't even really call it a triangle tbh.	18
206104	Yeah, I am! I'll private message you a link to my profile. Thank you.	15
147177	Policing is inherently coercive. Anyone who opposes coercive authority must by definition oppose policing.	10
27922	She forced him to sing a valentine song by threatening him with anthrax and then called him pathetic for allowing himself to be manipulated.. sounds like love to me.	0

97038	Thanks for explaining it to me! I did have an adaptor thing to connect to HDMI, I will double check tonight	15
149398	I actually want to die rn. I don't want to watch the SB but I know I'm going to.	19
102088	Yeah but vanilla ice cream has a Super Bowl ring and regular trips to the playoffs.	27
131423	Oh yeah, it's really dehumanizing to have respect for people's private property and not steal it from them whenever we feel like it...	27
184029	That's probably caused my the extreme density of infrastructure.	25
168035	The most siamese cat thing ive ever seen- weird, sexy, playful, smart, deadly. 	27
55089	1 And I pulled it back in the same way she did. This was a few years before I was informed of the the preferred method.	27
30274	Sure. The subject of her video was certainly creepy and obnoxious.	2
155310	the most romantic thing that can possibly happen to me	17
65880	Meanwhile my cat still hasn't voluntarily touched my 1.5 year old son	27

200073	Thanks. I needed this reminder today.	15
164412	Thank you, and I am. I'm definitely fine with regretful parent, I'd flair myself that if I had an actual computer at hand.	15
120144	It appeared that she smacked her grape pretty damn good. Oh, and I chuckled. 	17
113826	Dude alcohol is literally poison and talking about tryna self medicate?	5

153856	I was too mad to continue with the second episode lol I see now that he's married and think HOW?	6
59115	Wow, I’m going to have to remember this one...	22
17311	I figured that’s a British thing. Is that not a British thing?	4
208739	There is a reason I said allegedly.	4
10426	I kind of want to try that now actually. With some chocolate added I think it could work.	8
112668	“I can’t stop vibrating!” [NAME]: ( ͡o ͜ʖ ͡o)	27
97469	Wizards really embracing the tank, having [NAME] playing the 5 against [NAME]	21
210930	Lots of coffee, if anything. I think he was just nervous. Dealing with media/cameras isn't for everyone, after all.	19
30422	i never liked any star trek but its great listening to them talk about this dumbster fire	27
69001	Ah! I couldn’t remember his name!	27

102390	gag me (notice the nearly matching wardrobe colors)	27
93906	Wow either [NAME] misspoke or I didn't hear correctly. I swear he said chainsaw, that is totally different from knife or cooking accident.	27
155328	Don't be so hard on yourself. Often, things need time. Don't beat yourself up over it. 	5
69653	Do you need a safe space? Maybe a cold drink? Being easily offended doesn’t make you right.	5
163085	Yeah, because it’s soooo arduous to look at someone’s profile for five seconds. 	27
136091	Don’t worry, he’s more afraid of you than you are of him. Just act tough, it’ll work...maybe...	14

135384	"I didn't know this was a ""reveal"" he'd been talking about for awhile. "	6

52772	I love the immediate cut from the gladiator dying to the defeat screen. Makes it funnier	0

117095	seems like an odd time to post this	27
31317	Literally shaking, I hope you're getting the support you need with the ptsd this has obviously caused.	20
168320	The sad result of far too many gamers needing addiction mechanics to continue playing one of the greatest card games of all time.	27
102545	I have but I sugar discreetly and I’m genuinely afraid to have that compromised due to the field I’m in	14
188418	I'm confused why you reposted this from this sub. I'm even more confused why you left evidence that shows this.	6

143503	Thank you.	15
148544	After watching TLJ, I find it impossible to watch TFA. It's a sequel to some film, but that film is not TFA.	9
139155	I've never heard [NAME] complain about *post*-marital sex. So after you get a divorce, tear off your clothes and indulge your lusts!	5
110486	Without US attempting to do a regime change by funding jihadists in the first place there wouldnt have been a syrian civil war.	27
199267	If you don't mind cutting your life opportunities by 3/4 go for it.	2

157626	I dont even try to land it, half the time if I am flying low a building or the ground will suck me up and destroy the plane	4
94120	If ANYONE told me upfront they were a whatever game console guy/girl, I’d reconsider dating them. You’re too into video games. 	27
108511	"Finally, someone that understands you don't just get to keep information from your spouse about cheating to ""protect them"". That's crazy to me."	1
66931	I would feel like the biggest idiot if I made your comment.	12
148989	My favourite part is that the Saints are completely right, but it doesn't matter a god damn bit.	3

119248	Matinee games always scare me, but I have confidence in this team. LGI!	14
7824	If y'all didn't like OKC before, you hate 'em now.	2
117920	Again nothing, you are the one obsessing over that term, he literally says he puts girls on a pedestal. 	3
151702	"[NAME] damn son. the fact that you said ""re-education"" made this 5x better too lmao "	2
42966	I personally took this of his snapchat.... [lmfao	4
31484	Is this [NAME]?	26
44676	He's great in Silicon Valley too!	0
197850	It's one of my most hoped-for things. I think you should be able to approach a player and request a duel. It would be sick	4
194725	3/10 bad troll	9
113049	Oh good grief! Put it away, [NAME].	3
137480	. . .k but it's unlikely since unless you're a liberal and a woman thinking emotionally often shouldn't be a thing.	5

73096	I'm sure they love plenty of other snacks just as much!	27
160490	Actually it's quite hard to decide without a proper reason. Under what circumstances do we have to do that?	6
201459	All the more reason to wish that [NAME] can continue with Daredevil after what Netflix did.	27
40880	Right?? The hypocrisy with the [NAME] situation is STAGGERING.	6
4528	Yes but legal issues and plus its a bit weird tbh. She doesn't look 19.	27

153593	I am just a regular guy. Maybe you guys should talk to a specialist....especially if you are trying to conceive. Good luck!	15
24900	I wish I could be desensitized to my sadness sometimes lol	25
100978	We’re not upset. We’re disgusted. You’re disgusting.	10
10052	This sounds like prime /nononoyes material. Glad the cardiac issue your mom has were detected now and not later.	4
46784	For some people its about not wanting to look cheap.	10
14185	Ok then.	27
68493	That’s true, thank you	15

8645	didnt he think to check out the back?	27
210556	I’m single I’ve had it thrown at me But I’m being more choosey about who I spend my bed with this year	13
125110	Group hug to you and our fellow redditors :)	5

146607	[NAME] fucking dammit	2
8209	I love the small hole in the clouds with the moon (sun?) peeking through	18
134255	Also, money. It is a cost-prohibitive procedure for many who desire one.	21
14309	I don't see the weirdness there. Also, yes, him then and now could spit in my mouth and I'd be perfectly ok with it.	4
185166	Like I said, funny. 	1
94537	If money's not a problem for you and you badly need to get braces then go for it, the sooner the faster your teeth can get adjusted.	5
159429	Wow, now that you say that . Although, we do have [NAME], South Park, Family Guy and American Dad now. Mmmmm, [NAME] 	13
174338	Oh thanks this is really helpful	15
50775	My dad wears that sweater every game day! It’s in much worse condition however	11
186924	When everything is amazing all the time then nothing is amazing.	27
142398	What do the [NAME] have to do with it	7
156226	Of course not, but the purpose is to look a bit alien, so I'm ok with pushing the limits woth PS in such cases.	27
152409	And there’s no reason to drop the f bomb when giving an argument	3
200864	I’m glad you fixed Minnesota, because there is a 0% chance we will go Red.	23

27988	The BBQ ranch and Greek are my favorites!!	4
60410	poor [NAME] is in jail now for assassination.	25
205183	Good always love him	18
159097	Which suggests nothing in itself. The same mods you claim are abusive are probably as hyperbolic about the racism issue as you are.	2
145772	Good luck. :)	20
116711	Correct, there is no such law that obligates a woman to make her body available to gestate a fetus for someone else's convenience or amusement.	4
187570	Was at the game yesterday and at the game now. It's a miserable gong show. Why do I keep doing this to myself?	6
10964	"Give me an example of the discussions they are silencing with words like ""racist"" ""sexist"" and ""homophobe"""	7
16486	Blizzard was working with Activision long before Hots. I'm afraid its too late now, to divorce.	14

145273	OHH this is what Reddit finds ridiculous about this situation.	2
192947	I still carry an onion on my belt	27
110631	no, $950 plus enhancements. but with enhancements mine is better than the white Arabian was.	22
48288	I played a lot of WW2 ranked and had a tone of close games. And the point of ranked is for everyone to be around a 50/50 W/L	27
43870	Def not nypd lmao, but u hear you 	27
113107	I want one of those so badly! Perfect bag, perfect color. And of course they’re not for sale 	27

94448	That's true.	4
8254	"simply reply ""no."" sometimes youve gotta be rude."	25
144021	Forgive me for being so forward but you’re hot af	0
153805	Yeah I meant it has a cork in it. Sorry for the confusion haha	24
159170	>Shes completely self-made too :) Now I'm imagining her as some sort of entity that brings its own existence about	27
153376	Good. Now all that is required is that people don’t show up.	22
17480	Yeah probably. But the thought of [NAME] and [NAME] installing democracies instead of authoritarian dictatorships is utter nonsense.	17
185682	Well gee, you keep electing the people who do it, so what are you complaining about?	27
113859	Makes me want to go shit on the doorstep of 540 Hampshire Street (Good2go HQ)	8
136865	She's a complete nut but she's def a good one	9
104206	You sound scared	14
62141	I gave up trying to be 'normal' years ago. But I get your point though.	22
3228	I think he had other, more important things on his mind at that moment.	6
144241	Right. It was wasted screen time. But oh no, we couldn’t have a Snoke flash back that was 30 seconds *at most*.	9
8304	> that hurts my enjoyment of society. Then what could you possibly mean by this?	7
192441	Good luck for everyone pronouncing [NAME] name. If he keeps scoring like this, i'll have fun listening some commentators around NHL.	15

81098	Would you fly to Miami to get the last word? Lol	1
165329	RemindMe! 2 weeks	27

194286	This sounds like a tangent from Brows Held High. I like it.	13
138943	I actually live in a place called Star City (ironically a really small town) so I thought it was the coolest thing to me.	22
179800	This is one of my favorite details/hidden views in the entire city.	18
86233	is a recent article interesting read.	27
171701	It's so freaky. I'm a 40 something and the stock photos and really odd taglines are just baffling to me.	1
1230	Am yisrael chai is a phrase we should never take for granted.	4
45600	Yep because running a blower for 5 minutes caused it. Not the millions of vehicles or factories we have.	4
26829	Sometimes we pick the bad option to make a point.	10

126670	It’s hard to be negative in that situation.	3
56369	[NAME] a fucking idiot and needs to be primaried out.	10
111299	I don't disagree, but if he's open he's gonna shoot	4
185211	Play the lottery my dude, you just got lucky.	20
141594	That dude is Russian intelligence	0
11059	Oh the T word	27
6152	Just life.. I feel like i'm just a parasite that should be removed.	12
65159	Didn't he say [NAME] should cave and give [NAME] his wall money?	27
135019	This is scary to know that you went through. People like this are one step away from coming home with a gun or knife.	14
26318	Tool fan from the U.S. here. Something seems off about this question. Cheers, mate!	27
171527	Wowowowow!!!! I’ve been campaigning for [NAME] too!	1
90138	And isolated rooms? When I had to go in with my baby with chickenpox they put us in a room where no one else was.	14
60090	Weezer and squeeze her?	27
142661	They want to make gun ownership so expensive and onerous that people won't even bother.	27

34417	Maybe 5-10 games in the g league would help knock some rust off?	20

73570	Any response helps and makes me feel like I’m not alone....thank you❤️	15
49054	Even though [NAME] has had so many drawbacks and made some mistakes, let's make one thing clear: it's NOT a time to trade him.	9
112808	It's also ridiculously removed from reality. Dying to a disease or injury from an accident is orders of magnitude more likely than getting shot.	11
55137	Good point. Thank you. My condolences for your own loss.	16
97577	Thanks for the post [NAME] hang in there bb.	15
9381	Finally, we can put [NAME] down at the bottom like the EXP thief deserves.	4
183498	Who would have guessed Libertine Gold and Black posters would be coke heads?	6

121648	😀ahhh I see what you did there, clever.	0
39234	I love when [NAME] is a bit more bias with a call when [NAME] isn't. Always makes me giggle.	18
189527	Can’t wait to listen! Look forward to each episode.	7
91046	I don’t feel like anyone’s blaming him	27
37446	Everyone just called me the bad guy and said they're glad she's marrying him and rejected me and that i deserved it.	6
138932	toy has lost its value	4
159859	You could notice he was a little bit nervous, i think that was the main reason for his way of playing in this game.	4
109385	Sorry to burst your bubble, but winners write history and since leave won ... */dodges incoming tomato*	0
141869	Same thing I thought haha	1
202893	I would hate to see another [NAME] situation where [NAME] gets hurt again because he wasn't fully recovered.	2
52605	>she looks like squidward when she smiles LOOOL	1

1698	Anybody who likes to drink water with ice is a degenerate	27
128130	As anyone else ever **needed** waffles before? This winter morning is killing me.	14
18285	I love the fact nobody talks about boycotting the Times (owned by the same media group), because they know scousers don't read it anyway. 😂	18
72898	Far enough, np. Its rough communicating sarcasm in text form, especially nowadays with Poe's law in overdrive. 	3
162570	I hadn’t seen it and appreciated it!	0
113457	[NAME], I could’ve written the last part, and the first part serves as a potent warning.m that I needed to hear. Thank you.	9
207215	I wouldnt go that far, but paranoid schizophrenia can definitely do that to someone. Even mild social anxiety can also cause it, though	14
65248	Really? I had no idea the bioavailability was the same	6
1735	I think you spoke too soon	10
111732	Independent fact checkers have gone over Wikipedia and it turns out it is of higher accuracy than any other encyclopedia.	27
66349	i believe he has a minor ankle injury at the moment, i’m not too worried about his skating 	27
72215	We were by far the better team - [NAME] had no chance on any of the goals. Bad mistakes by [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME]	8
68675	I get hella pissed when people who are shorter than me complain about being too tall.	3
190282	Every time I get a distinct *[NAME]* vibe. A bunch of savage children devoid of compassion and understanding.	27
182355	Yeah I'm not arguing there isnt recreational potential though it can certainly mess you up. Doesn't help most products with dxm have other active ingredients.	10
90211	This is really cool and well made!	0
195606	Nope, not me. I am primarily a cyclist and drive as little as possible.	27
186855	Being a [NAME] is no different from being a [NAME]. Both have caused genocides. I hate how our society only focuses on one though!	25
195978	Seconded. 8 years and I never reached the final castle.	9
190495	It's nothing on you. I just hate the idea from a justice standpoint. I strive for fairness as much as I'm able.	8
13471	It is a very common verbal tic among tri-state Italian-American women of that generation and older. It takes me back to my old babysitter so vividly.	17
39922	I love those examples. Thank you for sharing. 🙏	15
97570	I probably should have seen that... I watched it without sound, and just thought the guy was drunk.. 	0
805	GOATs is what killed overwatch for me, this patch is probably gonna bring me back. 	22
202727	she always acts like the older sister who’s copping out of babysitting, it’s ridiculous.	27
163210	Yea I checked a few. It's supposed to be creepy I guess	4
117132	Rip [NAME] and [NAME] if [NAME] exposes everything to [NAME]	27
206230	That arm flail of “ahhh stranger danger” cracked me up. Then sealed with a boop.	27
205356	Yep. He also said it’d happen on a Manbij patrol	4
16240	Don't the [NAME] generally accept inerrancy? It was the universal position of the Church Fathers.	4
153973	No. We have the same desire. No one should be told how to live.	8
101139	"When he said, ""IT'S CALLED RESPECT"" and gritted through his teeth-- wow, he is just waiting to let his hands fly."	26
156323	you're going to relapse in two years because you have an illness that makes you use excessive amounts of things to cope with emotions..	5
85375	It was a customary practice of prostitutes in the Arabian peninsula.	27
55295	I got a far related cousin that killed himself this exact way. A branch punched back the chainsaw right back at his forehead.	27
98315	To be fair, people still go on about [NAME] 	4
195013	I liked [NAME] too, but I'll take [NAME] over him 10 times out of 10.	18
59022	Lmaoo a team full of [NAME] blunders, sometimes I feel like it’s sabotage from the man above 	9
94481	Can I start getting excited for [NAME] yet	13
104711	You guys are horrible. I love it.	14
179221	I’m genuinely surprised that [NAME] didn’t believe [NAME] lipstick speech - like that shit genuinely moved me	25
137387	They're obviously not.	10
200301	Everything in here I want but all we can do is pray to [NAME] for our wishes to come true	27

83281	You might also like /r/grandpajoehate	0

24970	Ok. Hang onto shit you can't change and be whiney about it. This is a reason why we catch shit. We can't take it	3
99311	That’s only really annoying if it’s excessively slow	3

4395	I honestly have no idea what [NAME] offers Genuinely don't rate him	6
172978	I was expecting the surprise birthday, not seen this twist on the sister before. 	26
203406	YOUR momentum doesn't help you, its the direction you're aiming and THEIR momentum that does. they were probably backing up when that happened.	10
138365	Her absence is probably the greatest present she can give you. Enjoy it while you can.	17

127828	> and was getting blocked like crazy down low We talking about [NAME] now?	3
118997	Snatched her up with the quickness	27

184297	But if [NAME] wins... well, things might change.	20
144059	Excuse me who the hell is that?	7

52867	Are 3% of [NAME] really vegan?? That’s fantastic!	0
132561	That explains why this has suddenly become an issue now. I wondered why no one cared for the other thousand months ranked wasn't available on mobile.	3
124588	My mistake, after almost 15 seasons it's a little hard to remember. Thanks for letting me know!	15
164378	I really don't think healthy people with no other emotional issues regret having their kids.	10

199541	Stunning considering you have the exact same opinion.	17
25077	This is more like yesyesyesyesmeh.	27

135293	Because he thought he could do it, but he couldn't make himself pull the trigger.	27
155946	This just isn't true. It was before [NAME] prime.	10
160809	Oh look [NAME] piggy backing attention at the end there.	7
92675	You didn’t change my mind, but that’s actually a very interesting thought “the Skywalkers are the imbalance”.	0
182373	That's horrible, good to know she is with an awesome guy.	17

171891	Wow, I might actually watch this weirdo movie this time. 	4

162509	I refuse to accept that	10
101430	Me too! Just figured out how.	4
181599	Your personality comes off as really obnoxious and overbearing. Maybe your thinly-veiled desperation explains why she didn’t want to go out with you.	27
7097	I don’t know, I think we all just blunder through. 	6
83452	~~New?~~ We~~’ve had em~~ in Oakland ~~for a~~w~~hil~~e ~~now and they still~~ are a mess.	3

63499	You really going to claim our foreign policy is equivalent to that of Iran and Russia?	7
202477	Another strange signing. [NAME] seems great at spotting backup players. 20 odd signings and probably 4 have been decent?	3
25917	I thought [NAME] trained her after the boxing was over?	27
78802	Stupid play.	2
150566	Dude I have a verrrrry strong feeling the barber did that on purpose. Nowhere in the world is that an acceptable haircut. That’s fucked up	9
62437	No worries. Just giving you a hard time!	23
116014	2 2nd rounders but not a first or a future first. He’s not worth the risk	10

38125	Yes, I know. But thanks, no damage to the second car and just some scratches on mine.	15
197228	Good to know the obsessive thinking is because of them... I’ve felt like it was just me ha. Thank you 🙏	0
79244	I hope someone got fired for that blunder.	8
51831	Shocked we didn't take him back and plunk him in the minors.	26
205671	Capitalism thrives where people are exploited more. Think about 19th century Britain (or America for that matter)	4
119716	i want to see more [NAME] backcourt action. I don't wanna see [NAME] shooting right now.	8
153000	You gotta be a fucking idiot to use a regualr wooden pallet for a bale. Blue or Red pallets only	2
79507	He looks like he has entered the ultimative stance of mind	15
33533	I love this because she doesn't even start out well and end poorly- it was bad the whole way through.	18
34267	Whatever mental condition he has is far worse than autism.	11
108480	Not to be critical, but “rethuglican” is an awful one 	10
152561	I get it but it wasn't what i was talking about.	22
86002	Hopefully one day EA no longer has exclusive NFL rights...	27
53312	I’m a baptist and I laughed at this statement, have a nice day funny boi.	3

137733	"You know he was too distracted by ""boobies"" on his teen wife to care about the realistic possible outcomes of rushing into marriage with a teen. "	8
196576	I couldn't muster up the energy to read through it all. They're on a different level, and it's not a compliment.	27
66787	I mean China, India, and Pakistan have nukes and won't exactly take being exterminated lightly.	22
126080	This is not helpful to OP who is going through some unbelievable trauma.	9
97879	"And of course, instead of calling out the men responsible for this behavior, the ""Not all men"" crowd has arrived in full force."	3
164287	Because all those delusional people be doing the same shit in their real life.	27
174505	Completely serious here, what do you base that claim off? Like, from experience and talking to people or from a larger scale example?	7
200039	LMFAO wtf that's great	1

39940	You mean the trip advisor era.	27
4462	Seek out a therapist? It sounds quite depressing n I wouldn't want it overwheming me.	25

46460	Freaky, more like creepy	9
197473	Haha yes. Thank you. No accidents, so it went well 😂😂	1
20828	In what ways has [NAME] out-coached [NAME]? I see this all the time and yet never any examples.	7
158149	Exactly. My father is part of Homeland security and is furloughed. Homeland Security isn't completely shut down but they furloughed part of their work force.	27
111253	Yeah, I took it more like “not us, but the radicals” mb.	27
139897	One year non guaranteed That's what they meant by death star.	27
97347	He has a humiliation kink. He's clearly not expressing it in a healthy way and should probably see a therapist and/or a professional [NAME].	27
50616	I cut onions to hide my feelings.	4
171779	Nope, no deal far more likely to starve the country than U-boat blockade.	10

135566	 🎶 Hark to the tale of [NAME], and the boy he loved so dear. They remained the best of friends for years and years and years. 🎶 	27
209831	Pretty old when you're 12.	21
181029	High five to that shit. We have 2 littles.....we are also exhausted lol	1

143325	He's been holding back for the last 2.5 years. Seems to find it easy for some reason...	27
102501	I like that they have a red light camera there to combat the red light runners. You can see it flash twice at 0:48.	17
173660	I suggest that you start by not apologising before you do something harmless (e.g. the beginning of this thread)	5
166691	"Also these people: ""millennials are so desensitised to violence that they have no problem shooting up schools"" "	27

174075	Still no [NAME] on before him.. we're supposed to be proving how important he is to us	27
24926	You’re right. Thank you for the context and information.	15

113770	The new movie doesnt even look very good honestly	9
205836	I didn't think I could love [NAME] any more. Is there a central repository for all of these battles	10

70918	Look at a calendar. Look at the 14th. Look at the week that contains the 14th. That week, any of the days on that week. 	27
20432	the hate we get in here is palpable.	20
17752	We know blocking [NAME] was [NAME] choice because he said it was.	27
194119	"Must be sad that you waste your time idolizing ""Pros"" and being a absolute poser in front of your freinds "	27
169676	I’m impressed.	4
118207	I always thought the U was for urine .. well this is going to be awkward.	27
191840	Whew. I'm safe then.	27
131297	True true. I concede.	27
164916	Thanks, I find your poor implementation of punctuation to be very amusing. It's good that there's something we can enjoy about each other.	13

101910	“Lol that’s Sammie coates replacement not minds take it how you want to I am back”- [NAME] - AB	1
180924	Because the other option is Labour And they are treacherous	27
62223	More moralizing and prejudice from you. Why am I not surprised?	7
103176	Yep. That's what made me kiss my SO for the first time. Those eyes. I don't think I'll ever forget.	13
151484	“That’s up to you” Clearly it is not up to you, or you wouldn’t have had a flipping miscarriage! 	10
34356	That would be awesome	13
11671	I've been trying to as well, but the game is so scary :/	14
126010	You sound fun at parties	17
145803	In that video, the pulls a sweet drift into a ditch and blows up.	6
79368	its not about claiming its yours, its just about where it is from	27
79698	I mean, you can't be any more in the friends zone if you have a matching neck tattoo with the chick.	27
81092	They are still trying to get him conditioned. That's why.	27
209199	The rest areas and truck stops are booming!	3

93166	I wanna see a video proving it's fake though	7
145128	I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not. Either way. Lol	1
83493	This is almost irritating. Like, take a breath, shithead..,	11
162189	Completely serious here, what do you base that claim off? Like, from experience and talking to people or from a larger scale example?	7
55938	Today I wish I were a black bear.	8
63503	Lol it was a joke. Meta from r/askreddit	0
145929	No this is [NAME]	27
60264	Yea this seems to be a common view actually.	27

2195	oh damn that’s a pretty good idea!! thanks!! :)	15
85628	Nice strong heavy stream will make it through	27
67876	Too bad [NAME] is going to be completely overshadowed by [NAME] to even notice.	27
174666	GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE RUDY	2

173984	This helped me when I was in my worst mental state. I'm glad	17
5426	Omg where did you get this?	7
171516	Athletes in the making. Can't wait to see them playing professionally.	27
74077	So then what are the odds the refs had money on the game and a vested interest to ignore calls?	27
1112	I am. But I presume you are gonna tell me I'm wrong because it doesn't line up with your experiences - whatever.	3
187792	Uh oh. I think I love Calabro. That was a hilarious call. Gotta love it!	18
209446	Go to your room.	3
207094	It might be the other way around! They seem to have a lot of awkward conversations while eating dinner.	12
185681	Intresting. Well I sure did learn something today! Cheers!	27
55019	I would do that all day until she learned not to put her dirty feet on the dash!!	4

70694	Refs stink already.	27
183428	That's so creepy	11
102918	Does it have to be a pharmacy I’ve went to?	6
144855	Well the house is burnt out so there's not a lot happening with it expect probably insurance folks need to investigate the damage.	27
30288	WE AINT NO RACISTS. EVERYONE CAN BE HATED EQUALLY.	27

44842	i didn't knew your toe can get that flat without breaking the nail in thousand of pieces	26
82348	Maybe we knew someone was going to sigh and this was all in the works. Just a thought idk. FUCK	6

101309	Aaahahahha- you had me at Jabba the Hut for a role model 😂😂❤️	1
88436	Feeling is exhausting. They used to feel those things and now they feel nothing because they're so burnt out and tired	27
136377	Love your username	18
31721	I must not understand this	22
9196	You have no clue what you’re talking about. Minister of Defense is [NAME] from the ANEL party, nothing to do with Golden Dawn	27
6222	[NAME] has a nice text on this topic. Of flying cars and the declining rate of profit.	4
2859	I think that you might just need to wait a little for the right significant other to show up	4
38684	I’d love it!!! Can you get it to Long Beach?	18
151197	Nah, they always were a government's tool to enslave us	4
161293	This hit way too close to home. I’m suing for emotional damage.	27
111920	Just look at Speedwagon. That man is... a beauty to say the least.	0
87269	Great piece, thanks for sharing.	15
42000	They aren't horrible in the least bit. Just learn from your mistake, remember, and move on. That's all you can do.	5
156857	You've been muted. Usually awarded for extreme toxicity, don't worry though its temporary.	5
87623	I know he will be, I'm just nervous. His face is just going to be so sad 😢	19
93541	You miss the sidewalk wing massacres as well I'd bet	4
3401	I love Chinese buffets. All the ones in my town are gone, all buffets are gone, sucks 	9
72478	Yeah exactly man haha. Not just that core is bad but hc is always more fun imo	1
180893	Lol ok. So saying a garbage clip doesn't belong at the top of a gaming subreddit makes me a [NAME].	22
21651	Don't feed the troll	10
160582	You did it!	4
126069	I don't know, but there's probably a word for it in German.	6
188602	Lead is probably 5-7 points, similar to 2018. The race was closer than expected, so there’s no reason to lose hope.	20
24827	Sweaty irritates me. But Its not exactly drag lingo. I've seen it on so many other subs too.	3
95906	No we’re going to use it for penalties decisions, red cards and goals like it’s designed for.	27
54452	o7 o7 o7 o7 I couldn't donate sadly	0
63012	happy new year buddy!	0
12194	I loved [NAME] as much as anyone but he started to become really inconsistent in his final stretch here before he ended up in Charlotte.	18
148829	You’re fighting an opponent who wants to fight you too. There’s mutual respect right there. You’re not fighting [RELIGION].	4
107007	"My bad. I typo'd. It should have said ""how""."	9
128403	That was a perfectly crafted joke and I see nothing wrong here.	1
188465	I’ve never been in love, haha. So I wouldn’t know.. thank you for this comment :)	15
141797	Always look before you jump.	5
67110	Don't see a W tonight. We need a miracle.	8
61896	I feel like itll be less like we imagine but similar to the magabomber. Just some crazy dude living in his van	1
177612	need to stop over reacting about *everything*.	3
127627	Good [NAME] ^(that's perfect)	27
64594	Yup that’s what people don’t seem to realize.	22
135357	[NAME] damn fruit booters.	11
96572	Nutter is a great word for it. I haven't even gotten into her claim that she is psychic yet. That's a story for another day.	27
160375	a mad men fan? nice. unfortunately i dont have any idea where to get this at.	6
81588	I don't remember if I've entered	6
142659	this gif encapsulates exactly how I feel commenting in FT vs everyone else here	27
84740	This is pretty funny. I’ve known dozens of people who fall into all of those stereotypes.	1
63703	sorry my fellow youngsters, we're illiterate.	24
173891	Seeing the Reverend talk to his son like that always made me feel uncomfortable but also mad.	12
148079	It's one of my most hoped-for things. I think you should be able to approach a player and request a duel. It would be sick	5
127791	SO FAR I couldn’t even listen to all of zombie bastards and ckth was mediocre	2
26860	It's not you, Taco Bell is grade D racoon meat and isn't fit for human consumption.	10
37579	Or they will die!	27
124748	They might trade for [NAME] or give France a chance. Still scratching my head at letting CV go.	27
118260	Ah ha!	26
49720	Please don’t downvote me I just have a question What is wrong with libertarians? This sub seems to hate them and I’m one.	6
147887	You need to stop focusing on him and focus on you and your daughter.	27
133454	Because your very wise mother KNEW who the real wankers were and she couldn't be bothered... Smart lady.	27
41477	I hope Edmonton gets nuked.	27
64679	I absolutely love how you can't read what's in yellow somehow it perfects this cringe	18
83285	My personal supply is always well stocked, thank you. You're welcome to it if you'd like an alternative to Arlene from Accountings baby feed.	15
169998	That is pretty small damage. I wouldn't fix it either.	3
63594	Just so freaking miserable. Trying to make me miserable as well	3
209718	I don't think you've ever seen the dsm. If you knowingly do something stupid you don't deserve anything but what you get	10
50583	It’s not that they MAY not become priests, it’s that they CAN not become priests.	27
86313	Do you think each worker looks after only one child?	7
30023	I now know what taking acid would feel like	21
187928	Most valuable comment	27
80683	They weren't, though. They were just sitting there which is to be expected when you have someone on the verge of being arrested at any moment.	27
201944	An imaginary god won't make you feel better, that's right, just the one true Living and Eternal God of Great Mercy who loves you.	18
34590	I'm late to the party but she looks like she could get up!!	4
186113	Not until she's 30, because adult women are not your property to control even if you are their parent.	0
27217	We had cheap rings. He threw his out the back door during a bad fight. I flushed mine.	27
154950	Self confidence I think and the fact that I’m scared if I do give all of myself to some that they won’t reciprocate.	14
9238	This way it becomes undeniably clear that it is the [NAME] who are the problem.	27
133381	You're right! I DO remember the refs being trash in that game as well! Thanks for the heads up!	15
205170	I enjoy vintage cooking porn. A young [NAME] trussing a round roast, for example. 	17
137985	You say weaboo, we say virgin	3
3281	Man if you want some crazy dreams, slap on a few nicotine patches before bed.	5
199383	"""vampire [NAME]"" "	27
154352	Maybe. Or maybe its going to make the US stay. Some peoole are saying it was done to keep the US from leaving syria.	6
72483	>They talked about it a lot in early 2017, specifically mentioning r/Minnesota. Lol, someone found one comment that had 3 points.	27
108084	Players need to have Agency over their characters. you did not. total crap. :(	8
4890	Yes I would rather have a government agency waste the money on food stamps. Right wing moron.	8
60370	Also the referee can send off a ballboy if he feels like they've committed an offence worthy of that.	27
132696	Yea Op, have you even seen the inside of a nutshell?	7
145759	What a pathetic reply. I know we’re all supposed to be nice here but c’mon.	3
47291	I stand corrected, my apologies to the mods. I'd personally like to see more banned or removed but at least they handled the most egregious.	24
148645	I mean maybe to the casual conservative, but people who believe Hollywood is a [NAME] propaganda machine usually already have the swastika flag and all I would think.	27
82212	Everyone knew that deal was stupid from the moment it happened, [NAME] was like 38. We just have to pray he learned from that	5
154168	This is amazing.	0
84502	his talk show is pretty great	0
96806	Everytime I get to hug someone.	27
113927	Yeah, but geology doesn’t provide enough pumped hydro. Not enough places to do it.	9
208603	Sorry that you lost that stuff. But that's a lot to have in your car in SF	24
175766	Splash your face with cold water. Refresh.	5
192996	Boycott Gynolette!	27
121884	She's why [NAME] doesn't want memes lol, she's a goldmine	0
85070	I always worry about my facial expressions. You're not alone there.	9
186060	Hey, she's pretty hot	0
186171	Go and be around friends. Or become an INTP so you don’t have the lingering feeling to be around friends.	27
42577	I hate these cakes so much.	2
34764	I love how someone put a laughing emoji on that.	18
60323	MAD JOKE!	1
11710	There's absolutely no question personality effects the outcome of an interaction, however a personality can not make up for lack of physical attraction.	4
173176	31 here. 2 weeks is ridiculous.	11
111314	most issues with nervousness and anxiety can be eliminated by eliminating the bad habits that are causing them to begin with, instead of 'just exercising/meditating' more	5
59153	But at least you know where you stand with a restraining order. At least 1000ft away.	27
45557	Yeah for sure, they're too smart to go to class anyway, they've got time.	0
52125	Bipolar symptoms tend to be very fun and exciting, but they can also be very bad and harmful. She should get some help.	1
81220	Yes that would've been so much fun! You can only imagine my shock and disappointment...	1
99421	You said that it is a fact that [NAME] is a rapist based on the testimony of 1 person. I merely stated the same argument based on your logic.	2
13681	I like Celtic fans more than Buck fans	18
1604	"""At least you're not this guy."""	27
185058	LIGHT THE BEACONS!	27
94123	Prove your faith-based claim.	27
38975	People are legitimately monsters.	27
147026	He was! And people in my class would be so hard on him about his accent. I hear the guy teaching the class now is really good, though!	0
119144	A lot of people shit on wiki edits, but most of them give me a nice little chuckle	4
129824	The wage, you Fucking troll. But you don't care do you? See your post history.	3
189168	the problem is that it's arbitrary. USA already has too high standards for immigration	19
78305	I measure from where the back of the balls are. It counts. Especially if you tend to go balls deep anyway. lol	27
194699	I didn't even cringe at this, I unironically love doggo mems	18
120843	And the new sword is kinda shitty, and not even a complete sword at that price. Also, the sword is really bad for the environment.	9
152047	that's ok, I'll come join you someday after I've finished all the tears here so be patient ! : )	5
67141	My vanity point for my love for SS is that it has a lance lord.	5
89587	Okay this meme is getting old now.	27
94111	Already I can can hear the screaming and howling of the neoliberal right. They will amuse me.	27
117927	I’m not sure it was [NAME] that changed the definition as much as it was the ATF.	6
9971	Reminds me of this classic	17
69650	*youve doomed us all, evacuate the continent immediately*	2
57333	And it keeps rumbling... now we know why no one had gone to jail yet!	22
68887	She even looks like a trigglypuff.	27
2597	I understand that there are issues. However, if someone chose to stay away from Perth due to the violent behaviour then where would they go on holiday?	14
198859	Aw thank you! Glad you enjoyed it :)	15
167025	I did love seeing [NAME] and [NAME] guest on the last episode of the Orville.	18
135765	Who knows with how over confident and glowing Lucasfilm seemed with TLJ I wouldn't be surprised by anything.	6
205684	Offense is taken, not given. Calm down, you'll live longer. 	5
109093	“stay still” the best and most timely advice you’ll ever get.	10
96366	Boy I *sure hope* this isn't a weekly thread, how obnoxious, haha	10
210191	And please do not dab unless you are at bingo.	10
78656	We have the same feelings	22
74465	One of things I loved about this subreddit is the use of the old school meme format	18
147005	Ouch, that looks horrible. Tagged his leg on the dumpster. Lucky he didn’t lose a leg going that fast.	14
18752	He's just showing off for the camera there.	27
69779	The counter-clockwise was a bit too much for even a real anti vaxxer tho.	0
70223	I’d posit that there’s a difference between espousing generalised problematic views (as [NAME] does) and directly targeting individual children	20
47087	Happened to me today...ended my shift early.	27
197985	I challenge all liberals reading this to find me one ounce of constitutional evidence that [NAME] should be impeached	27
189573	I use the app, it's not embedded they just don't bother changing it.	27
16777	I'll be honest - I just want new stories. Not prequels. Doing things in the past are just too limiting with storytelling.	4
143540	Me too thanks	15
5808	And then they claim that being incels have nothing to do with their personalities.	27
121083	i know, but it's a paper weight?	22
33418	Yeah, obviously. But that the joke relies on calling upon how outraged [NAME] was that he was penalised. 	3
95305	What exactly is insane about this	7
118247	[NAME] country is this entire world. I hate that saying.	3
87770	I find that relatable: I too am terrified of myself.	9
34298	Completely understandable. Maybe mom should book flights a little bit farther in advance next time though!	4
174783	i feel this	4
177025	This guy looks like what [NAME] tells himself he looks like	5
133084	I thought they were butt fugly	27
40014	You’re fighting an opponent who wants to fight you too. There’s mutual respect right there. You’re not fighting [RELIGION].	27
137667	"Love how she was able to find a 'rabbi' from N anti-Semitic group to ""prove"" her defense of anti-Semitism. Just fantastic. /s"	0
69888	At least you get sunny on Netflix, they took it off in Canada :(	27
62558	They also had some kinda lemony dressing on the salad so the bottom of the sandwich was all soggy.	27
141785	favorite athlete of all time for sure. [NAME] and [NAME] are my other 2 haha. [NAME] up there for my own sanity	27
132412	RemindMe! 3 weeks	27
72875	huh. if there’s no pain, you’re fine. maybe just use spray on like axe or something to detour the smell 	4
74181	Not exactly starving though is it, so my point still stands.	27
84417	It's happening on the Villians side, too. Someone joins, sees Dooku is taken, then quits.	27
155017	W crazy game	27
53989	He takes so much abuse...and i appreciate it's him and not butcher or severson tight now.	0
52228	Don't you feel embarrassed at all that your country answers to a country literally opposite of the world from yours?	7
59023	This is really well put. I saved it.	15
50436	This is not porn lol	27
2183	Guilty as well!	19
26071	Probably smashed his oil pan too, I'd give that car 3 miles to live.	25
208101	Interesting, thanks for the article, guess they're just as bad!	15
198803	Lawyer up bro and report him!	27
143741	I’m sorry where is that?	7
126175	Well he has admitted lying. So start asking yourself these questions.	27
129129	Meanwhile my sister won’t even hug my goodbye when I drop her off at school.	25
138631	Would you’ve still got with her if you’d known beforehand? No judgement, just curious.	7
163557	Oh, their theme gives me anxiety.	19
45231	I didn't know there was a name for that.	22
108751	How could you ever get bored of place that is getting more and more enjoyable as you are there	4
209663	No insults.	27
125046	ET + 2 picks for [NAME] would be great	21
170919	We dont want or deserve to win this game. Sloppy sloppy sloppy	10
179020	-Port will finish bottom 4 -[NAME] will be a massive let down -[NAME] will win the brownlow	8
65244	Looking forward to seeing these people have their characters die in sudden and extravagant ways.	20
158907	This hit me a little too close to home	3
84735	Mine is Woman by [NAME] 😂 I get the chills when I hear that song. Maybe it is a hymn?	7
187787	Yo gg man I was the lobby	4
6241	I have seen some terrible minion stuff, I thought I've seen the worst of the worst. I was wrong...I was horribly wrong.	11
22914	No you wouldn't	27
41942	That's what you get for not washing your mouth for months.	3
143162	Did your finger go completely sloppy? Thats grossly awesome.	0
11842	That’s such a beautiful moment to find each other there and support each other even if you know you can’t have each other.	5

60550	This comment is very good and all but it got me thinking, *are* pizzas a type of tire?	0
154018	I don't bother diagnosing it in people with BPD. The handful of genuine DIDs that I was referring to were people who didn't have BPD.	10

58942	Putting them away feels so good it’s worth the frustration. Snipers dropped my career KD by like .15 >__<	2
78953	You are profoundly ignorant on this country. There is literally not one serious person who would contest the correlation between diversity and support for liberals.	27
104972	Yup. I feel you. I'm very sorry it happened to you, too.	5

73480	Did I just get called [NAME]? Achievement Unlocked!	6

86774	She took the fucking kids, huh?	11

46489	Why would he get upset? Your husband was the one who went to PreCana classes and knows that using contraception is a means for annulment.	7
45042	She was gonna beat him with him	27
64408	This is adorable I want an update	13

30926	Hopefully [NAME] falls to 6. [NAME] can start the season and when the time is right move on over to the rookie	20
91830	For me it is easier to believe that the Big Bang occurred via a natural process than through an external agent such as some god.	4
42053	Pure unconsitional love can also be dangerous: if the other person turns out to be an abuser you should propably stop loving them	14
138314	I know, which is why I said it hasn't been referenced by any *living* characters on the show.	27
12545	I came I saw He broke His jaw	27

83151	Here is another extremely informative video about the Wii Shop Channel.	27

72644	I love almost everything Ethiopian but by [NAME] is Ethiopian music hard to listen to	18

160780	You're right! I linked the wrong one. Thank	4
95671	I was messy..............then I became a minimalist.	3
149759	Probably, but I'm also fairly certain it's easier for a [NAME] to get in than an [NAME] or a [NAME].	27

43364	Ahh change.org, where change goes to...do nothing	3
57196	Thanks for this!	15
49171	Not to mention the small electronic machines that we all carry around in our pockets. It'll be interesting to see how this impacts online casinos that accept cryptocurrency.	22
113433	I shave my face. Take that, boys.	27
83305	Ooh, that's interesting info actually (*heads to capfriendly to check how many years until [NAME] is a UFA*)	17

29909	Lol nice. I can't say the same yet. What do you do for a living if I may ask?	1
150768	[NAME] has not been that impressive in my opinion. [NAME] seems like the clear-cut top guy.	9
56199	Cheers for the reply ;)	27
144334	I have a model gun IRL, similar to the ones in Persona You could imagine how fun it was playing through P3	1
15243	[NAME] I forgot the [NAME] administration literally invented a mass killing whole cloth to make a political point. So much has happened since then	9

172521	This is the kind of crap I'm talking about.	12
5608	Nice mix of trashy and classy.	4
178599	Lol “this is my opinion and it is very true.” You said opinion, didn’t you?	1
174691	It’s amazing how the r/synthwave sub is just endless remixes of this poster. And the LEGO Movie 2 poster is too.	3
74134	Sounds like they’re not responsible and shouldn’t have the right to have these.	22
17600	He still has less health than [NAME] despite being slower and bigger and literally revolving around trading.	27
184709	Wait...what?	27

138262	*whines and cries in brogressive*	27
177062	Yes I'm trips fail like that nothing you can do about it but brush yourself off and try again tomorrow	4
117079	Should have been bunch of whining abults	27
79479	At this point, LSC only exists to give socialists a bad name.	3
159338	The EU's 'red lines' are in treaty and legislation. The UK's red lines are just May's opinions, they could disappear in two minutes.	27
51613	He used to be a science teacher!	4
62780	We’ve been watching OP for awhile and warned him about his posts. This one doesn’t rise to the level we warned him about.	27
132682	Facts have no relevence here, you cannot use them.	10
204656	Thank you! Yeah, I can see that. I'm just posting old work of mine, some of the resolution isn't that great- apologies!	15
59217	Exactly why I’m saying we won’t land KD ... but Knicks fans do know a lot about dreaming.	10
166762	I wish there was a way to separate the moderation function of karma from the “I agree with you/I don’t agree with you“.	8
106289	i want my nuggs mom!	27
27151	Sorry for the late reply. Bought it on the NHL shop, they have them in both fanatics and addidas.	12
104308	And you've never driven over the speed limit?	7
20324	Just making a joke from The Office. My bad haha	12
22081	I can only enjoy memes if they have been AI-checked to have never been uploaded to vine or tiktok. Otherwise I can not find it funny.	4
62506	This movie is highly underrated. Part of the problem it has is that Rogue One was SO FREAKING AWESOME!	0
167590	"Your ""other people"" comment was."	27
186762	Thanks DB, I'll see if I can find the book	15
113183	Once we win week 1 next season this sub will turn around lol	1
15736	fuck off. let people enjoy what they want to enjoy when it doesn't impact you.	2
209581	I am ashamed of your sequel memes. Prequel memes or no memes	12
21726	The saddest thing about this is that most people truly in need are the last ones to ask for help because they don't want to be anyones burden...	25
112529	Just why? No one is going to want to eat their food out of it and placing something on it is pointless	27
73280	I always fall for this joke on here..	1
133893	Love when this happens. Thank you, oh wise one.	15
147876	Dammit, you know I proof read this and I thought it changed correctly but I guess it didn't.	22
128487	I'm interested, more than I should be.	22
120979	One of [NAME] elections revolved around his supposedly illegitimate child. Congress used to get into physical brawls. This isn’t some sort of untouched level for America.	27
138728	Hahaha. I see what you did there!	17
56345	"That's a nice way to say ""being forcibly removed as illegal immigrants.""."	27
201413	I can scream HEH MOOMEN	2
153110	I went to college in his hometown. He's a grouchy old man who cares a lot about politics	5
114596	Ah, so you've an ugly face as well. Can it be rectified via plastic surgery?	11
152790	"You can't post a Sons pic and then say ""I got this"", that just hurts."	10
40486	It actually gives me comfort, too. Whatever happens, we will all be there together. 	27
81896	That has nothing whatsoever to do with what I was talking about.	27
46331	The only way I can make people laugh	17
5595	Surely you've read this sub's rules. Come on, man.	20
43719	HA! HAHAHAHAHAHA!!! That’s amazing. Thanks for starting my morning off with a good laugh. What a couple of idiots.	0
80401	You just posted the same thing but made it worse.	11
177884	OP, u/christiangreyisdraco and u/lurkerturndcommenter, thank you for trying to make the point about focus. I appreciate your many attempts!	15
145316	At least I have a source champ.	27
190590	I'll admit that's a bit surprising, since it's such a massive international hub. But beggars can't be choosers I guess. 	20
111813	That is SO cool	0
17133	Attempted years ago. Blocked by crooked politicians in bed with InBev and big beer. Gross.	27
108952	I'm here with a devil axe and 34 Krit chance. And my killer axe just broke.	22
53769	In that case the bottom queens would probably not learn the lyrics	27
44191	What is his endgame? People are talking about him but this just makes him look bad.	7
130342	Which sex communicates better? Typically women. Don't judge this guy like your girlfriends. he sounds pretty normal to me.	4
141529	This might be the worst FO in Orlando magic history	9
22039	Can’t fault you there	22
198658	Yeah it doesn't impact much except when they break and cause billions of dollars in damages and irreparable consequences to the wildlife.	11
15754	Oh wow. Yeah I’m very new, only about 8 hours gameplay	0
93405	Horray for Persona	27
15066	Ugh. That was not information anyone needed...	27
191159	What about white supremacist? BLM called [NAME] a white supremacist terrorist, that label is damaging and in the same lines of a neo nazi.	27
111778	Ditto this. Happy hour after work is nice and low-commitment.	17
48575	For the sake of football and this sub everyone wants [NAME] to win	8
109562	At the very least our shithousery is better, and I highly doubt there's any [NAME] who can outda the da's on here	3
192801	And every [NAME] on Reddit has an anxiety attack...	27
23384	just a single point	27
21731	Wow, sorry, bruh. I didn’t realize we were in the presence of genius. Please elaborate.	24
51426	BEHOLD THE GREAT GRAIN [NAME] BECKONS US TO ITS CHAMBER! FOLLOW ME MY FELLOW BIRDS INTO THE ABYSS!	2
58226	Well that was disheartening.	25
157058	If I went to a party and they had SFV I would cry of happiness.	1
103988	You can hear she's already starting another lol	27
124790	They'll just confiscate it here. I remember I had a pocket knife in my bag that I forgot about. They just took it away.	27
29340	Wow, you must have no idea what medium of exchange means.	1
75747	[NAME]’ column the other day had an interesting line, “zealotry is often people working out their psychological wounds.”	7
148407	I’m The Avocado™️	0
134928	Well why did you respond to me rather than starting your own comment thread?	10
118930	Yeah. Whose fault is that... maybe the terroristic Gazan government stealing all their money. I’d say that’s a safe bet.	6
53127	I propose Istanbul. I don't think it's dull, I find it incredibly appropriate and amusing.	0
22758	That was 1 scene and I think was more about her sense of powerlessness in the situation	4
189967	How do you hire the former DA? That sounds super helpful...	0
155248	I’m really starting to like that kid	4
82710	Sorry, I’m out of the loop- are they on this season as well? I forgot about them	7
19893	So birds and limes are bikes. Wow, TIL. 	13
177908	B plug? What the hell. Use an A plug or you're never going to become doctor some day.	6
177342	No Deal has a decent chance of leading to Scotland and NI leaving and thus the end of the United Kingdom	10
52190	Nope. Glad we came out with the W	17
183649	Shut up, [NAME]. 	2
75766	lol not wearing any clothes in the pic	1
188046	>Found out that **my** [NAME] Oh, I get it. You've caught the scent of a lesser stag in your nostrils. Pity!	27
100415	:) dormant intp. Unlock awakening	27
142776	Hmmm Then it becomes about the wording of proposing to have dinner together, doesn't it..	27
67327	Not exactly a question but thanks for all you did on the Mets.	15
141434	I knew a guy named [NAME]. Always wondered what his middle name was.	6
113312	This is still an inappropriate photo, no matter what type of dog it is	27
11504	All I can say is.. good luck bro	0
66753	I was expecting the top comment to be the copypasta. Glad to see that wasn’t the case.	15
129645	Just checking in with my fellow zombie pale girls: what kinda brains do you like with your ghoulish pallor?	6
65663	These Red Dead Redemption graphics are amazing	27
94346	I think people are more worried if he'll stay or not than whether he plays at the same level or not.	9
173961	I’ll never understand people who freak out at that, just say they were born a different color.	4
88180	We need to get some away wins now more than ever. 2nd half of the season, no more time to be circle jerking each other! 	22
76945	I heard her affair wrecked his marriage. His wife saying anything about that would wreck [NAME].	9
128502	Lol, like I said, not everything is about you	1
144752	(I tried to answer this in my below comment but I also just wanted to say I really love your username)	18
134407	When you buy the dog you get a lot of training to go with it and it's usually then further trained to specifically protect the person.	27
131512	I loved the reaction the cast of BP gave when they announced Spider Verse won. They couldn’t contain their excitement	13
178932	Imagine running willingly into a new pair of broken ribs.	27
26506	[NAME] just wants to post pics of her facetuned of herself for attention while acting morally superior to those other girls. fuck off	2
163165	I like it! It kinda feels like new territory, almost more real than old reality shows. It’s funnier and lighter too	17
103434	Damn, I'd better avoid you then. I don't wanna die.	3
145551	Good. Now we just need people to dislike commies more than they do now	17
22429	Those are the [NAME], they sing backup for [NAME]. They’re awesome!	27
207411	[NAME] and [NAME] were amazingly cute when both were in their awkward phase where no one had the guts to step forward.	27
70911	She should be FIRED	2
33122	Oh they should also mount a shelfie stick on the pike wall to capture all the action!	27
50798	Ok. He is likely done in the NHL after this season I guess.	27
161418	That's fucking awesome! I had no idea they would straight up off a dude for trifling! Lmao Winning information forsure, cheers man.	0
30583	Boosting is when someone else is the biggest ad-hominem yet, because it was in a situation like this.	21
44845	Man I just stick them on straight away. Don't really care if I get some type of infectious rash.	10
36439	"damn, I searched ""mocap"" and ""motion capture"", but they didn't use those terms in the title there."	2
18517	"I love any story that includes the phrase: ""Some gypsies showed up"". "	18
184474	pretending the issue is your wife cheating on you is why you're not learning anything	9
28642	I mean if you hidden the initial hit you can punish anything he does after	27
15666	I like it...but I still wish it was another new grump episode. I know I'm spoiled but I totally miss 2 a days.	3
17680	The only thing we feel entitled to is privacy and and being free from the harassment of incels like you.	27
40469	I feel the same at 5 feet 9. Feels bad	3
154378	You are such a good boyfriend, keep it up!! I’m jealous :)	0
59975	I like [NAME] but he's biased. If he's planning to becoming a real journalist he needs to leave his bias at home.	9
36490	We’re honestly not doing that bad besides [NAME]. Clear pen, unlucky. Let’s hope for the best in the second half	20
137271	Have you found any of the students with you have common interests?	7
27149	And no fall damage	10
198004	It's already a thing though lol	1
110382	You realize I hate trump right? You’re super annoying I’m not dealing with this	3
70217	And your folks thought that that Liberal Arts education would be worthless!	6
190401	Yeah, you’re just delusional. It’s ok to admit you’re wrong every now and then.	27
188709	i’m running, hiding & avoiding this man. poor girl. her story is a sad one 	5
33911	Keep any hat you find.. Now for only 100 gold bars! -Rockstar	27
25321	I love how they keep getting smaller 🙊	18
129218	Wow this was awful. What kind of audience do these morons have? I mean no one with the money to buy that junk would watch these fools	3
22402	If he was a rap ‘musician ‘ then I’m all in favour.	27
124000	Because all our society has done for the past 60 years is talk about your problems.	27
9620	Waterspouts might be one of nature’s most beautiful dangerous things	14
54820	I noticed this last night when rewatching [NAME]. Her daughter was easily 400 pounds.	4
33066	Why the fuck would you go for pizza, subs or pork rolls in texas?	2
155110	Right now! What should I do!?	7
35987	Wow really? I watched a fair bit of KR Contenders. I guess I just wasn’t paying that much attention.	26
181916	Don't apologize for a joke,especially when its true.	27
158288	I’m seeing a doctor tomorrow. Thanks for caring	5
48774	Because it’s a lot for someone to handle and i haven’t had any outbursts etc that would’ve resulted from that	10
194628	Yeah definitely not like my welder boyfriends hands for sure	4
195594	Would not be surprised tbh.	27
140775	>a water molecule spends around 600 years in Lake Superior. I guess it takes a while lol	1
54576	Check the Quad reddit. What you want to know is there - too long a tale with too many details to attempt to explain here.	27
119923	GSC is my strain and I want to try some legal stuff but dear lord, $82.	27
104373	Omgggg i’m dying at Stassi. She looks like she was going for a jersey shore look. Shes still gorgeous though	8
76976	Did you even read the discord logs?	7
97865	I saw the video. It was more awkward than anything.	11
37243	Let's not pretend that all fetishes are fine.	10
79531	>I mean most of the native tribes beliefs are centered around Pleiadian star people. Nope.	10
29456	i wish i could be an ex someone wanted to get back with.	8
35852	I prefer 240 grit sandpaper personally	0
135129	Go on the website it’s super easy to get hired loading trucks that’s for sure	27
158506	WE FOUND THE HERETIC AMONGST US!	27
209290	Yay, another second tier free agent over 30. Thank God we're making a market for these players. Go Mets!	4
200025	Like a football, one arm, head in your hand, body against your arm and don't fumble 	27
176484	That’s beyond disgusting in every way.	11
41107	Because learning another language is cultural appropriation. This people are pathetic.	25
124641	[NAME] you sound like my father, I feel sorry for you	19
106870	Huh, so there should be no more men's and women's sports, bathrooms, prisons, etc.?	27
203327	It was still controversial at the time which was my point.	27
21612	Sure hoping so!	20
69076	that speaks to my soul on a real level.	27
189030	Cut the guy off and gave him a yes-no question. Which he exasperatedly answered. This is not the way to listen.	27
94131	*pounces on you* uwu you’re so warm	26
79122	Hi, this is ISIS. Yes, we did that.	27
104161	I love CoD4	18
184090	Bet they're like 12 lol	1
128390	I appreciate you stat heads because I never look at TS or really any of that stuff tbh. No advanced metrics for me	15
9219	A bag of pita chips is really $8?	26
10243	Welcome to switzerland 😂 I see it everyday, when I'm on my way to work. 	27
1384	So, I saw the video yesterday. I think there are real complaints by residents, but that video isn't normal, and absolutely crosses into antisemitism.	4
132780	Why can't America be this cool?	27
132883	I went to a destination wedding being the only single person. Promised to never put myself in that situation again.	12
46297	BF- If you dont beleive me come over than. *gf goes over to bf's house, sees bf* GF- Hmmm, I might be dreaming. 	22
165870	Omg actually?! I mean no judgment , I am just SHOOK 	26
148715	Calm down snowflake. Comment stalking from a week ago is really sad, especially when you're whining about something that I'm 100% right on. 	25
50332	Intension or The Patient	27
33733	LETS FUCKING GOOOOO	2
66302	Saying cancer isn’t bad precluded you from being a rational human being.	27
192034	Go easy on your mom; this letter sounds like it was written from a place of deep love.	4
30571	I get ya man. It happens to the best of us.	20
78119	If we draft another late round QB this year I’ll probably have an aneurysm	20
150376	I thought I was the only knicks/browns fan on this sub! That's cool. But yeah I love hearing him and clyde do broadcasts	18
169906	Anything that moves us away from the 5 man push meta on SnD. Playing SnD without stuns and nades hasn’t felt right.	27
140841	You joke but people would believe it!	20
139736	You see benevolent, I see cynical and morally bankrupt.	2
18550	Such season 1 vibes and I love it.	18
195045	Also how nonchalantly he hits them, like he's swatting a mildly irritating fly	3
144970	With the Mets, I expect the worst 24/7/365.	3
163247	Poor cats tho. Having to live with people like that	25
198099	Yeah I have no idea. I’m guessing she meant to ask for someone to “sit” with mama [NAME] in her place?	6
67958	Totally. I'd be happy if they put the food directly into my hands.	8
123416	DOES NOT COMPUTE WITH MANAGEMENT ALGORITHM	27
3217	Im so glad I grew up killing infants at hospitals instead of being on my nokia	17
41855	I think I’d take the long view - the good news is that at least she’s not pregnant...	17
144975	"Some do, others say ""Thanks""..."	15
79195	Good for you! So awesome!	13
139725	Stop gaslighting. It's gross.	27
207929	I never said they were garbage, just that they come out too frequently.	6
127707	thats right i do remember you!	4
78854	Wish they would’ve cancelled work when it was -40 last week but I guess that’s somewhat expected in Canada.	27
18683	I love it when they show tons of interest. Love it.	18
208611	Not claming [NAME] would make [NAME] look more stupid lol. If someone claimed [NAME] we'd be over the moon about getting that contract off our team for next year.	1
157285	Need chemicals. Love it.	18
22196	Also his Whirlpool seems to be bugged, sometime it stays for like 3more seconds even tho you don't get any damage from it anymore	3
63223	[NAME] is my 2nd favorite QB after [NAME]. Very high ceiling and [NAME] always seems to get the best out of his QBs	0
47743	Yes, when I need to get my jush, it’s freaking epic.	3
100971	What if she’s also the franchise owner who likes to get to know her customers better?	27
89719	Guys have been asking this throughout history. Trying to get laid without commitment is not okay. Marriage is important and so is the paperwork.	4
72591	Happy cake day! It'll be tough, but stick to it and you will come out the other side better for it.	5
164920	Thank you! I was thinking, man, I’ve never been corrected about this before. 😐	15
13962	It sure smells and feels nice. I also don’t find my hands as dry as usual compared to bar soap.	0
2890	Say what you want about me, I can take it... but stop slandering poor defenseless [NAME]...	3
53484	Who the hell has reddit in anything other than dark mode ??	2
176471	Because they are triggered. I’m just stating my opinion. It’s a bit fun.	17
107337	And [NAME]. That dude sucks.	27
1220	Thank you! My Bravo blog is	15
184000	I so badly wish we could all gain this mindset and keep it. How easy would life be.	10
150782	Ok this is phrased quite extremely, but respectively not many people watch lgbt stuff, like even the lgbt people watch more non lgbt stuff than lgbt stuff	22
152536	Thanks for clarifying, was definitely originally taught wrong then. 🙃	15
159741	This is **NUTS**!!! I still use both of these on my boyfriend, who thankfully watched this season with me and also hated [NAME]. 	15
75942	Good to know! We didn't get any when we went Friday evening, but we can try again.	23
33151	For real tho let's dump our powerplay coach	27
83383	Should have drafted [NAME] and then never traded for THJ...Anyways, just happy we got [NAME] out of this finally.	27
78033	Not censoring usernames is against Reddit’s rules...	27
40048	That Facebook post was too loud.	27
74863	Imagine bragging about a “your mum” joke	1
37541	It's a decent flick. Id watch it	0
78467	His Fairy Godparents are just a hallucination created by his mind as a coping mechanism to deal with the hostile world around him.	6
205972	Ah Belgium ... being paid €500 by your employer, and only being allowed to keep €200 :)	27
172049	There's no in between. Your example is the only other way they could have handled it.	27
12031	Gotcha. I was married a few years before that, but you might have known my sister. She dated a guy in your branch named [NAME]	26
184879	And I laughed	17
187385	This was the scene that hooked me on the show.	25
141052	Struggling to get the basics with a $1,000 phone. Y’all need a reality check 	3
70990	I’m sorry you’re going through the hurt, this shit sucks so bad.. I don’t wish this upon anyone..	24
82802	Themmuns have everywhere infiltrated so they do !	27
5270	Ooof. I have a hard time trusting asexuals who declare this information mid elationship.	3
172525	I went to the exhibit in Chicago some years ago. It’s absolutely stunning	0
190626	Our soil needs the help! That would be a really unpleasant job.	11
189568	Being a woman is not an excuse, you do not represent all women. Thank the lord.	10
141812	They all say that. Mine said all the same things too and then just days / a week later met and started dating someone.	0
120782	Threaten to release....welp , nothing coming from this.	14
116584	Your right. I just didn't want to go into depth out of laziness	27
60857	Thank You, that does seem to be the consensus. 	15
43005	Hey we make money something u can’t say. Come back when your store can compete guy.	1
211091	Oh [NAME] i forgot about those. I used to love them.	14
101911	Please boycott them! I'd love some shorter queues.	12
3336	It's clear you dont know what you're talking about.	6
170495	That's interesting. As an orthodox [NAME], I woulda either kept using the offending term or avoided the name altogether as you suggest.	7
206862	I wasn't ready for the wholesomeness when I saw it.	10
15847	“The weird thing is she’s got a tattoo of our company on her back...” lmfao	27
9260	Yeah but if you do have a problem you'll be faced with a very difficult decision.	20
121578	I can’t translate /s to Texan speak well and forgot so my apologies y’all :)	25
84560	Horray for Persona	27
46698	I think I will try to push through, I guess I can always drop a class or two if it’s too much and even take a break 	20
167482	Very very very naive.	3
28760	Lol hows that different then [NAME]	1
161995	This! A while back a girl on here said that “the ed is trying to trick you to keep itself alive!”	27
93194	I mean hes been coat tailing, might as well make it obvious	4
208446	Once a week. It was a semi expensive seafood place, but it also had a poppin sports bar/happy hour vibe. An interesting place for sure 	4
14730	Rofl this pysyk kid is a disgrace	12
30385	It even has a name on it from the original creator you reposting scum.	2
61879	Always felt like this match would go 5. Come on [NAME]!	24
187951	Oh. Thanks. I was too lazy to read the [NAME] and just presented my opinion. My bad	15

102502	And according to [NAME] even Green Arrow couldn't defeat Cicada. Though wasn't that the non-butterflied-by-Nora-punching-the-satellite version of Cicada?	7
103211	Reading this made me pretty damn happy. Congrats hope it works out for you two.	13
62724	I haven't been able to find my 9th in the recliner in 3 weeks... 10th time is the charm I guess	20
98574	There is an actual subreddit for cheating. It's disgusting.	11
168559	"Can anyone here show where in the Quran it states ""not to delay your salah for anything"" ?"	7

96874	Many of them do love LEGAL ones.	4

73486	My girlfriend and I watch it all the time and love making love while it’s playing in the background!	18
166040	Sorry, but getting shot at causes an almost instinctive natural reflexive reaction to shoot back. I guess I'm just weird like that. 	24
133589	Also them dealing with mean and petty people especially in school	27
66940	Reg hunting is trying to kill me N1 or getting me lynched on day 2 or gamethrowing to make me lose or inv'ing/interrogating me N1 every game.	0
139818	Oh neat! I didn't realize you guys shot it. I figured the company had set up a tripod. In that case I retract my complaint.	4
116705	Highlights will be glorious to watch! Here’s [NAME] shootout zinger!	13
177532	I don’t care what anyone says. Party pizzas are the best frozen pizza you can get. Still mad about them being square now, though.	27

113708	Oh I thought this was about the Pistons making the playoffs. Since I wasn't paying attention to them, I actually thought it was possible. Ahahahahaha!	22
84244	That's the highest resolution version of that I've seen.	27
205882	Wow, you must have no idea what medium of exchange means.	26

71101	"""cool little surprise"" ow youtubers: NEW HERO NEW SKINS NEW MAPS NEXT WEEK?!"	26
79616	That was my wish in writing this. We all need hope sometimes. Some enchanted evening comes for each of us in its own time I think.	8
101297	I didn't know picks could be traded. Is this new or is it just rare in baseball?	6
16443	I’m so glad I watched this entire thing. That’s incredible.	0
38573	I’m more worried about the dude getting pissed all over my shoes	3
13530	This is good advice, and I apologize for freaking out. 	24
50563	My response would have been, If [NAME] sees me as unworthy, then I do believe that [NAME] would have more use for my tithings.	20
162020	What a game... completely down and out at half time and then... [NAME] and total annhilation of the scousers	15
210164	I remember that day, and I remember the disgraceful convention.	9

29362	Yeah that is definitely tough on the processor as it's running a software emulator and the game the whole time	4
176349	That happened at my college, ofc TFM had to come in and brand it as their own. What a joke.	1
128389	Well, I was going to surprise you [NAME], but what the heck...I’m gaining a bunch of weight to go on disability!	26
108853	Yeah no, I don't support people being questioned by police for any opinion actually, a sentiment I expect many people on here share.	3

159994	Sounds like people who are making a career out of being part of the bureaucracy have come across hard times. Shucks.	27
138797	Ah I love when I’m looking at a random thread and find you in the comments. Hey [NAME]!	17
32141	Shhhhh, you just have to belive it isn't yellow, just lighter blue and everything will be fine.	3
165010	You've been muted. Usually awarded for extreme toxicity, don't worry though its temporary.	27
116623	I think it's ridiculous that we continue to pay taxes to fund paychecks that federal workers aren't receiving.	11
191529	Well, yes and no.	27

195166	Nicely framed.	0
100653	Not to be a pedant but him being a corrections officer and her a felon doesn't mean shit to me about whether the abuse is legitimate.	3
61406	For some reason I read that in [NAME]' voice lmao	27
115782	I am like the panda one, thanks! I'm also following [NAME] memes and while it def isnt all recovery stuff it's highly relatable 	0

114951	Apologies for vertical view! Bonus commentary from my mini me that loves this sub!	24
72442	I used to do shit like this...back when I had a serious drinking problem I was in denial about	3
132152	Likely some more bitching about easily fixable features being swept under the rug by employees	4
20690	Regardless of bonus size I'd argue it was ProRevenge. It's a coordinated effort between multiple people that had a real financial effect on the target	3
76276	Doing X deserves Y. When you realize X = Y you finally understand life.	27

208366	She broke that young man's toes, ankles, and knees on that fall. lol	1
16107	We need some old school evil empire moves, sign [NAME] NOW!	8
16255	Fun fact that I learned not too long ago, [NAME] did the voice over for [NAME] during the “indeed” era of Kaientai 	27
203499	No I know. This group has been mostly helpful. And the rude comments were deleted by the mods.	17
102015	Can you link in the full posted videos where they yelled about the wall ? Thanks.	7
137852	When people don't understand things they invent gods. how little we have changed in all these years.	27
49384	Can you imagine the amount of backlash she’d get if it was ANOTHER [NAME] collab? Omg.	27
142333	"I'll say no thanks to endangering others in traffic. And miss me with the ""I drive better while high"""	27

94942	Someone did. The person who impregnated them. Humans don't reproduce asexually, you can't just make yourself pregnant	22
51386	Someone tell [NAME] to report on these threats to journalists and the first amendment!	27
96500	And it's stopped. Training cancelled :-)	27

56435	But but r/49ers said it was just bad luck!	9
202786	"Be careful mentioning the word ""dio"" on the internet."	27
55205	It is though. Certainly the worst Zelda game at least.	11
143766	I did it. Lol.	17
196760	The mom looks like my great aunt when she was younger.	0
69375	Wtf. And then we wonder why people think DnD players are a bunch of fucking creeps. Sucks that you had to bear witness to such sadness.	3

137774	I've never heard [NAME] complain about *post*-marital sex. So after you get a divorce, tear off your clothes and indulge your lusts!	10

200462	You can't see me, Vern.	27
45375	I like it, especially the shovel and therapy lines	27
140064	Was disappointed until I saw your username. What's up [NAME] :D	9
210300	This guy fucking gets it.	2
59039	I'm sorry *what*	25
74531	I would love to accidentally get muscular... Instead of working my arse off to lose fat at the moment.	18
120935	And please do not dab unless you are at bingo.	10

116465	You president now?	7
174710	Right, but their wages *are* lower *because* they get tipped.	27
160744	This times a thousand. They set us against each other so we don't realize who the real enemy is.	27
105460	Then how can you say the rest is very red outside of nova when that is blatantly not true?	26
109376	You ain't wrong	8
76075	Nice of you to jump in for no reason, very cool.	27
204904	I've never woken up to a fan around my throat.	4
23836	I need to hear more stories like this. I've only heard horror stories of the pain with the surgery as an adult.	8
10643	Good luck trying to get out of the membership. They won’t make it easy.	0
188622	The one fucking thing my home town has contributed besides alcoholics and [NAME] and its a fucking backwards feminist horseshit theory.	2
27673	Yeah I was super surprised by how good Trench was, probably my top album from last year	26

41078	With ice time and his defensive liabilities taken into consideration, I'm still not too high on him	4

133161	I didn't realize being in my late 20s qualified me as a senior citizen, where do I get my AARP card?	1

68956	I found a dentist (Aspen Dental) that text or email confirms every appointment and my doctors office has an app for everything from appointments to prescription refills.	27
210062	Well, it feels like the other truths would be more pertinent. If they don’t know what it is, then what is it?	27

21175	yea ok dude	4
201374	[NAME] was dork anyway. Be happy he ain't our hero.	3

175385	You're right... But look at that badass black leather jacket.	4
145942	If I told you, that would defeat the purpose of censoring. Let's just say it's clearly libellous.	3
141118	Wanna trade lives? I'd gladly take normal height with hair and have the same experience.	26
144978	Because it contains the nudity of a child, and that is a federal crime?	7
88760	Tuition is now WAY more than that. You need to come up with more like 4k per month--and that doesnt include any living expenses.	27
71099	Such a disappointment. Mobile games are such a shallow replacement for a full sequel. What a let down.	9
10810	[NAME], I’ve slaughtered [NAME] today, but the man has balls, I’ll give him that	25
72509	From the looks of those fingers seems like you'll eat it anyway	27
107520	Dude theyre in a fuckin hospital. Take them their food.	5
125983	Let me guess, are you [NAME]?	7
4562	wouldn't you say [NAME] and [NAME] are part of the same generation?	7
166257	Damn so the Patriots are gonna get thielen after all	27
135044	I would feel like the biggest idiot if I made your comment.	1
192543	To be fair the lore is so nonexistent other than on Ubi’s site you could probably just pretend that’s the case anyways.	22
114636	"""In Scotland, the word 'fuckin'' is just a warning that a noun is on the way"" -[NAME]"	27
16872	For both of us to be done school. To be in a secure spot financially.	27
39872	Have a nice day, sir. 	5
132884	About fucking time ordering ASAP	11
198336	that's some nice evidence you got there.	0
146860	Uh, sorry. We're under trumpcare now.	24
118268	I was entertained into the 4th. My sons played well. We lost. I'll take it.	1
127359	1-2-3-4 I declare a thumb war! Dangit [NAME], you win again! Ok you get to stab me again :(	3
75841	Thanks! I'm so keen :)	15
142299	Stolen valor, there's no way someone who is actually in the military wouldn't understand this. You're a POSER	1
138035	> ...he was afraid for his life... I see he has mastered the magic incantation.	0
27479	Thanks, the date went really well! I feel for you, it will be a while for me too. 	15
180089	I’m so happy for them. I hope he drowns in a puddle of bacon grease.	17
58221	I love [NAME] already	18
56919	He's also a chaser and is convinced that shouting at someone is an escalation from a shooting spree. He is incredibly dumb.	27
195833	[NAME] is a traitor to this country.	10
146080	The twist is that is that it was all a [NAME] fever dream the whole time.	27
31898	What I figured but needed some clarification. Thanks!	15
178818	thanks, I agree	4
4591	Watching her wardrobe/closet tour video. It’s hilarious.	1
206361	First thing I thought of, people need to know these things	27
87977	We know from experience that [NAME] couldn’t save a boat	27
188845	This probably not a good file to keep on your phone if you are accessing this from within...	3
22709	[NAME], [NAME], or [NAME] imo. But the cap is an issue too.	9
137694	She's a bloody sociopath.	2
160994	"I recently came upon the term ""that slaps"" in reference to delicious food, or simply an enjoyable experience. "	27
129785	It’s more of a vibe tbh I love playboi carti as much as I love [NAME]	18
166758	Thank you for explaining! I’m only 31 but now I feel old lol	1
127571	Just a simple man trying to make his way in the galaxy	4
11158	Omg lmao. Coming from [NAME] too is super embarrassing. I can't really say I feel bad for [NAME] though, he did it to himself. 	3
36392	I love that he wears the rad suits. You do you Mr [NAME].	18
57243	I borrowed an old wedding dress from a museum. It was a one size fits all kind of dress. Thank goodness!	15
43970	Get through Hartford by 7 AM or you're going to assume you've died and gone to hell.	2
61038	[NAME], give us the opera album we deserve	27
93410	Would feel weird swiping right on a leftie	27
171177	big heart to do that, guy probably plays for the love of the game, and you have to respect that	0
78975	And unfortunately there's no legal way for us to withhold our tax dollars to demonstrate the effect.	25
40178	Wow. [NAME] is a giant POS. He'll be really happy being single and dying alone.	17
47705	I just want to be alone in a cabin up north near flagstaff.	27
44821	Sports, not even once	27
57525	If New Jersey are going to win it in the winter they better get something done quickly..	27
64128	I look forward to finally trying the game out and helping you guys pump up those kill counts	13
21777	Oh I'm sure you're fun at parties	27
136625	Just think of it as set in an alternate universe where America didn’t just take independence but went back to England and established their own colonies there.	27
96770	What an idiot.	26
47475	I’m intrigued.	7
69138	Different doctors have different opinions on who should and shouldn’t be vaccinated.	10
103013	She had it so good with [NAME] as his ex. Girlfriend was so freaking nice.	0
160578	I’m offended that your offended	3
61641	Those of us paying attention already knew, but now the normies are noticing.	7
183524	Toxic masculinity' is as anti-man as 'gangrenous arm' is anti-limb Less so, in fact	27
81408	Everyone else's obsession sounds useful... I get obsessed with certain actors.	4
102601	My man!	4
3277	Your just killing time now.	22
124007	Maybe I’m unsure of that	6
41240	Should have grabbed her and called the police for property destruction	8
91992	Look at a calendar. Look at the 14th. Look at the week that contains the 14th. That week, any of the days on that week. 	27
107144	Wait.....What? You do know that's not how it works, right?	3
49020	I'm glad you could relate and that you also found some peace and resolution in your relationship. I'm glad we didn't give up!	0
40156	I'd be extremely motivated to take any form of martial arts lessons if they didn't cost $100 per month around where I live	7
121001	If being tired doesn’t work. Ask for a BJ	17
44895	The best losers of grand finals cod has ever seen	0
63790	You again.	0
192470	Worst episode of the entire show	9
68770	I will never understand why streaming is entertaining.	6
180830	what a ground licker. Day 9799 of being alive - I still hate people.	0
41416	You too huh?	7
114177	Damn, good luck dude hope it goes well.	5
46585	You good = are you ready?	0
169830	I guess I am totally alone but I am really enjoying the audiobook and haven’t had a single complaint. I’m half way through now	25
110849	That was so sad. And she kept calling for mommy the whole time. Then they ditched her with grandma.	27
32706	Find some good rats bro, and just run thru them man. I mean just plow thru them and get your sex game up. 	4
23796	The cost of centralized mandatory services is an example of socialism driving up prices. Get your facts straight.	27
173518	Woo hoo!	26
162041	I love how he says the crime *solving* boat, like there was another show about a boat committing crimes. 	0
14447	They’re probably fighting, that’s why she’s *really* getting out of the house for “self care.”	3
90825	Love the homeless encampment in the photo.	0
201666	[NAME] seems to have a sloppy stride	22
96044	It is the recent patch most likely! This never happened previously.	4
23938	We are very clumsy creatures. Eventually you just learn to laugh it off. *The crying comes later when no one is around*	27
29893	yeah. thanks for your reply	15
182034	Did I stutter? [NAME] is [NAME] in sunglasses and y'all act like he is [NAME].	27
60261	I am still confused a bit lol	1
171560	Hard to tell	6
65651	You deserve it <3	15
161465	Whoa. I appreciated this, thank you.	0
175427	I come up and hug her and say good morning, usually joke around about the dog or something. Nothing negative really	5
27033	That's the reason I am terrified to wear contacts on duty. I'm afraid it'll get stuck between my contacts and eyes and destroy my pupils.	14
30148	I agree with you, but you know, sharia *is* sharia, which I find a tad more frightening 	4
193096	Damn, that's low. 	10
177917	Democrips & Rebloodicans was my favorite.	4
167771	Time to start my end of life tren blast!	4
149851	Yes. Views are a real thing that matters. The very fact that a person makes an effort to appeal to voters is not.	27
91342	I grew up SDA as well. That probably explains my disdain for religion in general.	20
135829	Not really, I like staying at home. When I go out for food I'm in and out of the store as quickly as possible. 	10
169596	That's no excuse.	3
139438	*Succession* was fantastic. *Barry* too	4
187054	That’s crazy! Really bizarre. Is she off reddit too? I did notice fewer posts.	7
54230	"I saw these in a cart and I was so confused why the tennis balls were so small...then I noticed the word ""gum""."	6
83597	"They're a homophobe, just ignore them. Anyone who uses ""homosexuals"" can go right out"	6
137146	This makes so much sense. Seems she has been icing me. Time to call it quits	3
1890	People still do? I thought everyone realized how overpaid he is	6
80571	And what do you think the most important issues are? This one seems fairly fucking important.	6
152595	Starting 2019 with a bang......of death.....	24
206332	>Gotta love the South No. No, you really don’t. 	2
149834	Sorry man, you’re a great person and all. But margarine??? Downvoted*	10
34686	Any rap song because I hate it	11
51204	Normally the posts on this subreddit are pretty innocent and vanilla.....yeah not this one I think I’ll pass on “TheDickPill”	27
80204	This just oozes passive-agressiveness. I love it!	4
5696	A successful centralized ratings company?	27
112541	Another way to do it without screaming at your teammates!	27
130128	Woah! 4 new maps in a year! That’s so lucky!! Not like we got 10+ maps in 2017 for bf1..	13
191807	The only way to truly be yourself is to bare it all for the world to see.	27
8670	Was that before or after he murdered over a million [NAME]?	6
34097	You're a bit of a wet wipe aren't you?	3
81124	Being adorable mostly	27
163689	Omg i probably need to get mint to drop some truth bombs	27
90125	Those refs were terrible, god damn. GG Buckeyes, it was much closer than the score suggests.	27
202073	You just made my point, you obnoxious whining kid	12
13736	I'm surprised he hasn't already. He was charged on Dec. 31st but his name was only released yesterday.	26
21137	I got undifferentiated androgynous, just slightly more femme than masc, which, honestly, sounds about right as an AFAB nonbinary person tbh	25
183870	"Yeah, the golden nugget is ""Get over yourself and let him back in, he made a (small) mistake"""	27
35509	🤷🏼‍♀️ I was wondering the same thing. It looked almost like a teriyaki.	26
94418	IMO 90% of articles on the internet, or in newspapers or TV news, are placed by PR firms. Only children don't know this.	9
79236	I'm kind of struggling tonight. Bored, lonely... man 	4
186793	I don't understand how her hair is 'too light' or how that effects the concealer.	6
194171	Good. The US is behaving shamefully, the least Canada can do is to try and pick up a little of the slack. 	3
91436	You’re a life saver, wish you a blessed new year 	20
208785	I used them too, did a great job but they were super expensive.	0
145662	The absolute worst!	11
118735	Now THAT is a murder by words!	3
189682	It's got what plants crave.	27
170639	Can I ask why he isn’t willing? Thanks - I hope it works out for you. Maybe take this time to work on you!	7
142260	Did you do the frame check by yourself or someone else did it?	27
91666	Is this Engraze?	7
93080	I wonder so too hehe :D	0
82075	What happened?	6
207316	He helped him up. And [NAME] walked back, mad at himself for falling for it	3
199518	That partially explains why season 4 was such a fucking mess	9
46675	Thank [NAME] for the disclaimer you almost tricked me justin	1
52446	Yeah. Like you.	15
102066	Like the handout this guy got to build the stadium?	27
176660	Hey, at least its not a fucking sauce post! We really need a new season.	3
52894	I can’t even get high anymore cause “alcoholism/addiction” .... At least I have cookies I guess.	27
109240	using the crying emoji is a sin against humanity, and you should be executed via the electric chair for doing so. 	10
16570	Bruh. Same I’m sitting here wide awake barely breathing outta one nostril.trying to blow my nose every ten seconds and I thins happening	19
17959	Mozzarella sticks!	27
178741	Ouch. Hurts because it's true.	25
170657	I was browsing the site and just figured r/Browns would do the trick...NOPE!	10
43565	Every Saturday for the foreseeable future will be spent studying for the LSAT. Fuck	11
126898	Well at least he wont be hungry ever again	4
186475	That sounds really helpful, thanks so much	15
86050	The reduction in class size seems pretty small and insignificant.	9
81127	I clicked tive times on the Facebook like Button	27
49310	I can’t imagine having a plan B when it comes to dating. That just seems disrespectful to not devote yourself to the person your dating.	2
27259	Thanks ill try those things. I have access to adhd meds but i began losing a kit of weight with my chronic illness too	15
26082	[NAME] have a solid minute lol. [NAME] can’t sit at all tonight	27
57919	Sad thing is it would probably forcibly ground the plane.	25
171203	Yeah, but ask how many people know who [NAME] is and how many people know who [NAME] is.	7
82402	"It's ""Lo and behold"" just fyi"	0
152411	[NAME] is effortlessly beautiful. [NAME] looks ok with makeup, however without she looks...um....different 😳	27
178242	I'm jealous. I'm in California	3
10363	Ask them if they’re going to give you a “test salary” for it... if not, nope out of there. 	0
158966	I can't wait to see what us skilled workers get. Thanks government for telling businesses how to run and wrangle unskilled workers with no ambition.	15
31626	You can't choose what genes you pass on.	4
87232	[NAME] will get booed at home after a golden sombrero in May while hitting .230 and [NAME] and [NAME] putting up big numbers elsewhere.	4
145860	Disgusting!!! Where were the adults? The adults probably felt proud of their sons. Fucken toxic culture	11
187064	That's very disturbing to be honest, casually admitting you'd turn to cannibalism...? Ehhh	14
72454	Purple are lowkey great value properties.	27
177199	This may be overreacting, but I would not touch those presents. There could be a bomb in them. 	27
65012	And sing the beat !	13
17149	Would love to see her back but not a chance in hell until the series finale, if that.	8
53632	You will miss 100% of the shots you don’t take, you just gotta take a chance and see.	20
36478	I agree, this subs being a little overly toxic about it	4
56125	Just turned on the game. I hope I brought the boys some good luck	20
80142	> Suggestions like this are why Blizzard don't take their own community seriously. This should be this sub's slogan.	10
114608	Before we start obvi. I’m taking out legs before I get embarrassed.	3
107604	I like this title, fun to picture a violent lake stealing dogs! :)	0
147019	I appreciate [NAME] diving for that, but because he did, it lead to wide open Korver transition 3. About as automatic as it gets	27
176817	Patience. Give it another day or so. Send a text telling her you enjoyed her company and wanna do it again. Hopefully she responds	20
139548	Does that include [NAME]?	27
194408	Nah man presses, but good ones... the pharma kalmas are long gone bro, here in Australia anyway	0
65689	I use one every time I park and you just replied to me. so this is a bit awkward.	12
204908	It was pretty good, I didn't have the patience to see *all* the endings myself but spoilers exist on reddit for the curious (; 	15
208584	Midland has a ton of smart people. A lot of petroleum engineers.	0
151926	He’s a way worse version of [NAME]. I don’t think anyone is putting him in their top 15 besides Bears fans.	3
81310	> I find myself doing more stuff at home to avoid the unruly families that crowd the malls. You and me both!	27
165704	Talk about a fucking hot take. Quality shit posting from [NAME] (not you [NAME]).	9
204864	Do you remember if [NAME] was carrying a white piece of paper? Oh yeah...you don't forget a thing like that...	27
51040	Thank you [NAME]. Best of luck. I'll always remember your goal to clinch MLS Cup 2017.	15
182464	You could wish for it to cure stupidity atleast. Obviously it doesnt.	11
174703	😻 that's a line if I ever saw one	20
54261	When you feel nervousness, tell yourself it's just excitement. Makes a world of difference. :)	13
15200	You haven't presented a reason to not care.	3
96167	It would certainly improve some services (like transit) but would piss off enough people of both cities that I can't imagine anyone proposing it.	3
205294	One of the rare times I actually laugh out loud while browsing online.	17
120355	Not a perfect game with the error	27
100213	I was pleasantly surprised that I couldn’t think of anything I broke at my last retail job but... you’re right, that was it	4
207611	Yep. That will do it. Glad to hear the message finally sank in. Rehabilitation is the key to fighting recidvism.	4
167875	Sure. Minus the ones that decided to wear MAGA hats and harass the indigenous people’s march.	27
118563	Oh [NAME] I forgot all about this site for good reason	27
67646	I'm quite curious as to how recreational marijuana legalization will effect these rates. The first two factors are generally caused by alternatives of sorts to marijuana.	7
191815	Any weaving subreddits you'd recommend?	6
61924	For a second i thought you were talking about dubai expo 2020 lol stupid me	17
102359	I see Barca fans saying [NAME] is better and I can't help but laugh.	1
200436	Leave it. You should never date someone with a scheduled time you are going to break up with them.	3
106946	I mean it would be borderline targeting in college football. It was a really egregious missed call.	11
35097	The best way is killing people that don't know you. Also you could steal some things so the cops think that it was a robbery	22
102919	I thought that type of camouflage failed horribly because the high contrast and defined shapes made the ships really stand out.	14
114106	I love how their comparing [NAME] one shtick (not including highlighter) to the comedy skills of queens with actual performance talents.	1
117335	Fund this man. Even if it doesn’t pan out it’s worth finding out.	4
97275	What a terrible list	27
49318	I'm elated to hear that 🤗	13
210494	Nope. Sadly early 30s	10
114632	I still wish if we get a deeper face customization like in RPGs.	8
112051	I’m so glad they remastered that game, I’m having a blast playing it again	21
165455	It was [NAME] who said that in an interview too	27
203904	Luckily they were on the phone texting, which saved them from panicking/noticing.	4
154516	Alright cool thanks for the tip - I'll give it a try!	15
193444	Ah, [NAME] and his random crap again...	27
9304	Wait.... What??!	27
51897	If it's not too late, I'd love to have one of the binders!	18

210	y i k e s	24
186496	You sure its not just the host quitting which disconnects everybody? Happens all the time and its incredibly frustrating.	11
191381	Yes.... because they are dictatorships.... capitalist america is ending bad too if you pay attention.	27
166908	One of the comments on that video: “Cat: I’ve waited far too long.” Hahaha	1
144058	I'm honestly surprised you haven't been banned yet.	26
13537	Its like if i decapitated myself while shaving.	27
184756	Hey, remember when [NAME] said furries are all catfuckers? Glad he's changed since then.	7
70132	Oh *hell* no.	3
70187	Rebalancing all heroes for this purpose seems like a disaster. Would have been good to think about pre-development.	9
32796	Her parents are all for it, I made a good first impression and they're just happy that she is. Thanks :)	15
9852	It makes me feel good. Wholesome is a very subjective thing.	4

133023	Honestly, I dont see it. Like, at all	15
143817	Does this not happen to all people? If not then at least I found out a little more about why this always happens to me.	27
15047	I realised hatred does only more of self damage. Over time even the hatred fades.	22
112497	Havent been working for 10 years at this company about 5 now, but i have overall 10 years experience	27
141157	I'd look up some gameplay of Warriors games, and see if the hack and slash nature of them appeals to you.	27

82489	Is that meat or veggies?	6
127513	Ha! I like that one.	4
123637	This team isn’t winning the 2019 cup. I’m focused on 2022 and beyond	10

100482	Bingo. They are not an articulate people.	27

176806	Saw the police and they use an invisible boatcar to get this one is my first heartbreak.	27

182375	[NAME], I’ve slaughtered [NAME] today, but the man has balls, I’ll give him that	27
149943	wasn’t it just reported that the [NAME] report will be “anticlimactic?” Don’t like [NAME], I’m just keeping it real.	3

104066	A share house should be alright but getting a place on your own is pretty pricey.	1

144584	If someone has tithed 10% their entire life, fuck off with requests like this.	2
154974	Fair to say I won't have to pay pipebomb 10ETH. Happy New year, all!	27
49839	Take them out of his care and into the care of someone who can watch them until you are able to protect them yourself.	5
80382	Am yisrael chai is a phrase we should never take for granted.	10
119497	That's what I can't understand either, what were they expecting by knocking on the door?	6
131213	[NAME] MAY be a slightly better hitter, but he can't field for crap. And the other two can't hold a candle to [NAME]	27

179965	would it be like Caspian’s bombs where you have to directly be hit by it?	27
18129	If we were in the same city we could've hung out. Happy new year to you. You're not alone in being alone.	17
103054	I laughed so hard at this. 🤣	1
52059	"They didn't have a ""bullpen"" when they won the WS or when they went to the ALCS last year. They will get by as always"	20

39623	*Hey just noticed..* it's your **6th Cakeday** [NAME]! ^(hug)	18
205543	What a sweet, sweet bird! Also, that is one tiny pup!	18
105922	Alright, and I remember what [NAME] is but I’m trying to go to sleep so don’t remind me.	22
151132	I wish I could be as cute as that :c	8
18390	You cannot open or keep it. You can send it RTS.	10
15260	Yes please. What's that @ ?	27
202111	So sorry about your loss. It's so heart wrenching xoxox	15
174044	He had to much red dead 2	27
68982	Would destroying the business bring them both closer together?	7
32316	Really funny how our FO liked the 2 of the worst qbs. [NAME] and [NAME] That’s why I’m skeptical about our FO now	9
68947	Good for you, human. I hope you get the job!	5
76671	My turn should arrive this year. At least this place will allow me to leave my last words.	20
164840	Your mental health matters the most. You can't help him more than you do, but you can help yourself. 	5
25576	Oh wow!!!	0
154099	While I don't wish anyone death or even harm, I also wouldn't mourn his death.	27

96047	I really enjoyed [NAME] and I feel him on a spiritual level	27
20287	Oh [NAME], dont talk about clippers!	2
176161	I saw this on here less than 2 days ago. You could at least repost old content that we haven't seen in a while.	3
88155	Noted. Thanks for the suggestion!	15
94589	Just some statistics I saw bud. Calm down.	3
30400	Fucking refs suck my balls.	2
26623	I would feel similarly, but I would be more gleeful and less guilty. 	19
205082	persistence that is working perfectly fine...thanks to backup scripts lol	0
105858	Lmao everyone in this gif was absolutely clueless	1
127853	Me thinks this crosses the line of dignity. Makes me sad. It’s one thing to expose things but another to mock it.	25
113361	I feel like they would look at one of the Spurs assistant coaches if they were to part ways with [NAME]. That or maybe [NAME]	4
201685	The way him and his mom talk to each other is like a little boy and his Mommy!	27
142024	You die > mom will be sad	27
117703	I couldn’t agree more! I think deep down all I wish for is some weird validation from women	10
8099	Didn't one of those two idiots void their visa to the US over some political bullshit? I think it was [NAME], can't remember.	10
90055	"""Oh my [NAME] who is he? I get drunk on jealousy"" -[NAME]-"	27
53616	“You okay? I’ll call 9-1-1 for you guys.” -guy in the van that was running	27
187510	He gives political answers to political questions. He's still interacting with the public unfiltered and I can't imagine any CPC Prime Minister ever doing similar.	27
167045	True, C9 fans are manchildren	27
8221	That's ironic. Because [NAME] isn't getting the Wall funded, we are pulling more resources off the border blockade effort?	27
8360	i wear all black. always. i died when we launched la boulange pastries. pink shirt of shame.	0
95975	"Just ""asking for a friend""...huh? 😂"	7
91637	Sometimes the mouse attacks the snake ! I think you should start dating if he is going to be a asshat.	4
120309	Damn, I didn’t see any monkeys when I was there! What a ripoff.	9
205023	That's sad. I'm 16 and where I am there are loads of athiests my age. It's great.	0
142539	He won't cost over 100M, hopefully not over 80M either. That's cheap today.	27
15553	I mean adding a bit of avocado to a pesto dish sounds good but this seems like a yikes	27
69766	Ha. She cried because you influenced it.	3
117284	the upside is that they can hold quite a bit, so you can almost always just empty it in the comfort of your own bathroom	27
198934	ITS A GOOD BOI!!	0
182453	That sounds really helpful, thanks so much	15
121823	Tell him he should get a divorce.	24
208867	[NAME] just a beast.	3
154228	I am he does suck	27
169151	How do you think this would have went if those two switched roles? Probably not as smooth huh	27
74177	Aren't we back where we started? I'd say that if you're OK with animal torture, you're a pretty cruel person.	7
128088	It's weird because sometimes I care and sometimes I don't. Although I wouldn't call myself an asexual I could be leaning more towards demisexual.	11
154470	they could be extinct. plenty of creatures no longer exist anymore.	27
203790	I like your name.	4
54698	The article mentions that the apps are only for Chinese customers. Is that not the case?	3
112666	"What am I supposed to understand from the phrase ""1v1 fam, a duel""."	27
60699	Of course. It would mean you owe them an unspecified favor in the future. That would be horrible.	3
55433	Just remember some car insurances do not cover you for Uber/Lyft etc	27
177287	That’s an interesting take. Thank you for giving me some perspective, never saw it like that. 	15
50908	Yeah I usually do it if no-one will	4
197884	You're a good man, [NAME]	15
131466	When I was her age I had 3 jobs... oh you have like 18... get off my lawn!	2
75408	The man and dog have been spotted running past [NAME] and nobody is helping! I would help but I just had my nails done.	9
86792	[NAME] in AHS Roanoke takes that spot for me. [NAME] was painful to listen to	27
167711	Yup those are the two worst tasting out of my cocktail!	11
83537	Why was nobody driving the damn thing? They were all in the backseat. :/	2
133995	They didn't even spell his actor's name correctly...	3
70928	Hahaha exactly, and deciding on even the most simple of things	1
37245	Bet Highland Council are sorry they sold their bunker last year.	24
74526	Thanks for the suggestion!	15
193187	R1/L1, always played like this R2/L2 feels weird and slow	22
206464	And yet you had to walk back your support of this bill when you found out it would catch up your shotgun	3
192419	[NAME] cheats on you after a few months. Your ME1 love interest waited for you for two years, and they thought you were dead.	27
195074	"[NAME] IS SO CUTE WITH THE ""MINE"" SdgksadGDKLSG:"	18
123399	You are not well-informed. Their policy is in accordance with language used in ITS OWN platform, not elsewhere. So no.	27
114505	And in adult spaces in general. Let adults have things to themselves, damn it	27
28044	I don't even know how to begin explaining something this preposterously self-evident to you, so I'm just not going to. 	6
120004	Not delusional at all imo	3
88092	Oh I went balls to the wall and got SUPER SPECIFIC!!!	0
199768	Can confirm. I never dip pieces of fish into milk. Not makpid about cheese though.	27
104730	Oh yeah yeah	4
205292	ah good find. I guess I saw some sort of grade 9 class photo then. Cheers.	0
36290	Didn’t you guys have a bowl game?	7
53150	At least things are looking up with the next generation. That optimism sits in stark contrast to this news.	20
45790	any therapist will tell you emotions are valid even if they are irrational. Which i think is one problem with many TiMs.	27
145498	I shouldn't be giggle-snorting to this, but internally I am.	27
105331	lol that was just bad, [NAME] 	1
110541	You have no regard for due process or the law if you're suggesting [NAME] be charged with evidence tampering because there is nothing to back up that claim.	27
12223	It was so ballsy. I still shake my head, thinking about how....tactless it was. 	27
133754	How many of each have been killed or injured?	7
86155	That was the longest final minute I've ever seen	22
192625	"Lol I was just about to protest ""you can't know that!"" until I realized....."	22
102996	r/outoftheloop here; could you explain why this is good? I'm assuming he's a scummy shitlord.	7
57105	This guy is in prison for meeting up with a 13 year old girl or whatnot btw	27
10239	I want the man who makes me pizza from scratch and then lovingly hand feeds it to me. Completely realistic expectation.	27
10527	Mmk. Sure bud.	0
188479	The amount of empty seats at the Orange Bowl was pretty bad	25
83850	Happy Cake Day you barefoot bitch!	5
5070	Ok, but ignoring negative shit is literally how populists like [NAME] and [NAME] got elected. Its dangerous.	3
78106	Wait is this the original template where all the satire comes from?	7
78594	That’s adorable! He probably wants them all in one spot so he can make sure they’re ok and not getting lost or hurt.	0
184073	That place must be a gold mine of good stories.	27
130043	Rural MO. The nearest Whole Foods is an hour away. I can't imagine too many [NAME] could handle the distance.	27
100634	There’s at least a thousand hallways that look exactly like that with people that look exactly like that in America	27
3523	All the best to you in 2019! I hope whatever lies next for you is rewarding. :)	0
94985	Thank you!!!! for being one of the sound minded people here.	15
82906	Thank you, I love Heart and Zeppelin and haven't seen that till now.	10
165583	Lol Yes Most people arent 100% either (especially women). For a variety of reasons...finding beauty in other people, curiosity, jealousy, etc...	1
131955	“You fight like my sister!” “I’ve fought your sister! That’s a compliment!”	0
68812	I know a dozen local school administrators. What the hell are you talking about?	2
145314	> **most government positions**, especially elected positions **don't have any education or skill requirements** FWIW Yea they do.	27
56217	This was such a pleasure to watch. I wish more episodes were like Brianne.	15
73916	... Still laughed!	17
34054	People back then just might have had a bad memory and kept forgetting about it.	22
108565	My girl [NAME]. She deserves the world.	8
35453	Thanks, fixed it	15
190422	i think you could say the chat about smelling their own farts was also added for comedic effect	1
21381	I'm so jealous. I'm in NYC for a year and the lack of King Cake is giving me actual depression.	19
149539	Kawhi and Siakam chemistry	27
29183	Your opinion doesn't matter, the judge's does. Like I said, if you want better answers, then consult a family law attorney in your area.	5
2010	Weird, never had a problem	15
7366	It’s broken garbage. The most broken unbalanced tekken game by so much it will make your eyes bleed and give you a brain tumor.	3
17911	No, she tried and failed lmao	1
65652	They were not really messing around, just more frustrated. They genuinely were trying to move specialists around to get the best out of people.	2
113079	They ate not hot, they are just annoyingly humid.	3
99725	Pretty shit tbh with you	11
197685	It’s probably warmer in the freezer than it is outside. Oof	27
139013	I really hope not. Personally I have no interest in VR games, and not even my favorite game would change that.	27
157838	The best ad placement.	0
132736	At least we can all rest easy that it doesn’t happen in “The Zookeeper”	27
191099	I’m right handed, yet left eye dominant and straight... life is beautifully strange.	0
159588	Funny a lot of rich kids think 100k a year is very feasible.	1
56675	an obvious joke	17
45164	genji dmg buffs are eh but everything else except a nerf to zen are crazy	0
147771	I have no idea who those people are, but I've heard their names a lot.	27

199553	Holy heckin heck	26
140419	? I'm a dude so I was asking how often she feels like guys listen to her. Not sure what you're asking	27
169767	She has naturally chubby cheeks that are set on high cheekbones. I've seen it before and it's not abnormal.	10
160224	I'm guessing that insurance to cover the liability is a big part of it. It sure as hell isn't going to the wages of the employees.	8
152572	Congratulations, there are success stories in this group. Forge on with your life but watch out for other (jerkfaces). 	0
133696	Yes [NAME] are authoritarian. That’s why they’re always the ones advocating for bigger government and more government control over everything.	27
39768	I just heard about this, its pretty cool. 	0
133269	Well, at least she broke up first. It would somehow be worse if she kept it hidden and brought him the news later	27
50889	These are worse than the [NAME] ones [NAME]	10
158455	Bit salty about that karma mate	10
66048	Why not though? Not enough buyers?	7
107588	I recomend a Jasikevicius from Litva :) Sorry for English.	24
167122	I would gleefully look forward to a battle where fascist apologists and race baiters utterly destroy each other. Maybe then we can have a civil, unified society.	8
112356	Insane song.	27
159234	Tbh the giant cereal bowl bath is about as least cursed as it gets. ...I loved that episode	0
148836	I am happy for you. No, seriously, I am.	0
46609	I prefer to use a welding torch. I like the ozone and ultraviolet clean feeling and smells. Never have to wash the sheets either.	4
188535	You can't. It's best you go see a professional about that wound of yours.	4
204624	thanks <3	0
96118	Playing the golden oldies eh?	7
28246	They do sound kinda not worth it then. At least large ones don't sound worth it. You have my sympathy.	5
93517	This is great. Good Yard!	4
2498	Somewhere to buy a hella warm winter coat? #polarvortex	5
136189	The tactical alliance between PYD and the US doesn't fit the characterization of intervention. That's also not relevant to what the hashtag is about.	27
122911	what did he say i missed it	27
81107	the longest week (2014) I don’t know if it’s still available but it was pretty good romantic comedy	4

22379	Man that movie is such a classic	4
209136	One dude ended his [NAME] rant by calling him a socialist unironically.	4
68439	They are both just so perfect for each other	0
37480	"Maybe one ""episode"", but they're definitely going to go Part 1 and Part 2 on the third act."	20
209239	[NAME] blew it by putting [NAME] on the WS roster. He was horrible, and he hadn't pitched in weeks.	14
56825	No it's not. It's two people legally allowed to kiss kissing. Whatever stigma you have is yours and not shared by everyone.	27
58062	This is why I'm a communist. Eat. The. Rich.	21
74683	I can't post on r/dankmemes :(	10
7491	Might want to avoid those things even when [NAME] and [NAME] are kissing each other.	27
80653	Wanted something more on Imperius Angiris Wrath ulti at lvl 20... :'( Nice buff to Valorus Pursuit though!	8
7742	That's false	10
62553	How the hell do you get downvoted for a submission statement on /r/TrueReddit. Title or not it is still required.	2
73363	Hay girls, if you where make-up, you can't buy me chicken tendies.	10
127852	I just don't like OP for not explaining it before using the abbreviation. So even though the TIFU was great I downvoted it.	0

151468	Other than family, I neither remember the last time I got a compliment 	19
179709	Good luck.	20
42904	Like it was over wayyyyy too fast for a real one. Shit, the Taliban lasted for years, and ISIS is still a huge problem.	14
83974	**GET OUT NORMIES! OUT!**	2
127433	It's not even artisanal? You're a monster.	27
151349	I know it's easy for me to say because it wasn't me but money is money. We can always make more. Really sorry dude.	22
28801	I got banned on an old account for no discernible reason months after I had last posted there.	27
83247	Huh, so there should be no more men's and women's sports, bathrooms, prisons, etc.?	2
23988	I'd be more worried about the kids needing eye protection at that point.	5
14685	honestly this made me smile like an idiot on the subway, thank you.	15
184691	His main goal is attacking KSI's comment section	27

34895	Right! I pictured my kids and my oldest would probably MAYBE try once to show the little one.	4
211046	We, Saudi Arabia, have concluded that Saudi Arabia is innocent 	4
81486	Cats! I'm fucking sold!!	13

133674	He's hanging with friends...TV on, volume down. People asking, how are things in Detroit and he just shrugs and shakes his head	0
186999	By taking it as a nonserious game you don't need in order to enjoy and have fun with it.	17
182425	i wonder how people who are in college/undergrad who are in stable relationships do it.	26

133371	[NAME] with that birthday gift	13
186420	Um congratulations on being a housewife .. Lol?	15
195431	They are taking advantage of the fact that you found this thread and realized you have to do is one more day until you get it.	22

111657	That poor snake	27
159693	Reminds me of Stampy	27

1259	> If you have a point - make it. I did, I'm sorry you missed it.	10
118219	It's also ridiculously removed from reality. Dying to a disease or injury from an accident is orders of magnitude more likely than getting shot.	3

43838	[NAME] is da man. A gangsta mathematician who had the guts to seduce the most beautiful Spartan woman of her time.	27

8086	Do you work in education?	27
164207	You mean Ichigo/Nero/Black Ranger/I'm a Frog. Did not know that [NAME] voiced [NAME], but it does exsplain why he sounded so familiar.	6
86427	Is her fake chin totally to the right of where it should be here?	7
59387	Glad it had a positive impact on you. Welcome to the club!	0

171965	I personally think it should be illegal to let unsecured people ride in the back of your Bakkie. That section should only be for goods.	8
21947	Deal breaks what? You generalized and assumed I am part of the loud vocal minority.	6
184276	Fuck you bro	2
84270	Now? Look at what they did to rip the Black Panthers apart from the inside.	27
64688	I can't even get close to beating that one though... same with the salmon fishing one.	27

78645	I've removed your post for witch hunting. Please be mindful of that in the future.	19
183053	I believe it	27
65572	I agree. This is assault. Leave the ignorant hill [NAME] alone.	0

42895	No I know. This group has been mostly helpful. And the rude comments were deleted by the mods.	4
67101	What the fuck? Really? That’s horrible. That’s probably illegal. If it isn’t, it should be.	3

130941	Pickeks are nice idk how many calories I eat day to day lol	1
37679	At least no one threw water on him and exacerbated things	23
2433	True but also it's not a dilemma ; if they try something like Tiananmen they will likely die. So not very tempting to try to change things.	4
19432	I can’t figure out how to PM you but I have a question about something on another post. Mom of 2 here. 😂	6
96632	What? [NAME] looks like he’s hardly trying and completely disinterested.	9
9567	Because leave voters are now doing nothing for Brexit. It’s remainers running brexit now with [NAME].	27
20591	I can totally see it. I’d be very interested to see them interact.	13
44527	She manages to interview the most horrible people, as long as they're willing. Can't have an interview with someone who'll only attack your questions. 	11
94641	The article says an emergency declaration let's them skip some regulations on contractors... Overpriced no bid contacts to his cronies are on the menu, boys!	27
181906	El Niño is for pacific coast tho.. but yea	17

160242	AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE ALL CAPS TO GET YOUR POINT ACROSS!!!	10
115857	The middle was an analogy. No one here condones terrorism, as that's attacks on civilians, Destruction of financial buildings isn't that. 	2

112251	Good always love him	18

15108	That sounds really cool! I'll be there	0
164997	Thanks for the gold kind stranger	15
13648	I'm not sure why [NAME] would care about the backstop. Maybe he just wants to rile up the Tories.	27

8806	I have seen this a few times. Feels staged...	27
177420	Beatin’, bangin’, ‘n’ scratchin’ - [NAME] and the andrews sisters	27
67284	I completely agree, and I love Space Jame. But Back in Action was just amazing and incredibly satirical and witty.	0

101622	Honest to [NAME] make it stop, it's old news at this point omg.	10

33445	I love him even though the newest season of t@gged kinda sucked.	9
51107	Will do. Have a good night man.	27
47594	This is a genuinely good point. It’s enough to take me from giving zero shits to giving a modest shit against them.	2

195576	That's the spirit 🤣 for me it's more about strangers wanting to hug me. But you do you 😎	21
34600	"""Daddy, can you help me with my math homework?"" ""Not now, sweetie. Daddy's doing much more important math"""	4
85086	I wasn't trying to counter your whole argument by objecting to a particular bit I found particularly silly	10
199981	So, now that his chance of being PM is slipping away, he's going full [NAME] and invoking conspiracy theories. The man is scum.	27

93703	Hey, I described you in the OP! Everyone's doing it so you have to too, otherwise *you* feel like it's unfair.	22

150219	He was so close to me x	27
191589	Keeping his mouth shut? After cheerleading for the dictatorship, that's the least the scumbag can do.	2

64817	Joint bank account?	6

97603	Thanks! I'm now quite excited. Unless of course they all decide to skip straight from Chatswood to Gordon.	13
109329	I feel a little sad for her. That she thinks the only options or something to do is having kids. Fuck her tho.	2

167005	[NAME] is basically this really cool guy who had some progressive attitudes towards sex and now society vilifies him just for bringing some pleasure to nice young ladies	0
163923	[NAME] I know right? everybody knows that F4 only has 3 members	4
122853	Fuuuuck. I am so angry that this can even happen.	2
98914	Are you replying to something in particular, because what you stated is so obvious I would hope it need not be said on a science thread.	8
148322	I miss SFist's Apartment Sadness column.	25
143626	Damn. Didn't know [NAME] was still making videos.	3
187348	I know. Idk what to say after they say they already have one. I say oh good! And then it's awkward	4
151031	[NAME] is a happy boi!!	17
106658	it is very clearly incorrect, and it's apparent that your descent into reactionary politics has made you fully delusional. 	27
41220	Bisexuality: Sexual tension with everyone. Somehow a much smaller dating pool.	4
190763	I can hardly wait to see this guy paired with [NAME].	9
165840	I have crowns and I thought I needed a mouth guard but it seems like I don’t anymore.	22

27073	Me am be failed English and am unfaulted teacher not even frum England	27
7337	Well, the [NAME] should help us out, the reason we are in this political mess is because we detained a person for them. 	2

71389	He’s only caught herpes twice.	27
166208	That’s strange logic that it triggered you.. they will use any retarded attempt to hoover you he probably hoped you would notice and get triggered by it.	20
79889	I don't make a habit of looking at people's profiles over a simple comment. Tell me what I'm supposed to see from your post history.	27
827	Good on you dude. I'm west coast, but I'd love if anyone ever finds themselves in Seattle, I extend this offer.	13
133408	Pasta left to your door today is 4 years as outdated! Be aware. Some quality grammar there...	9

187620	Upfront. Costs a lot more over the term of the contract though.	27
210553	Well I get annoyed when they dont, because I'm always the one to answer within 30 seconds.	3
68564	Or just some kind of pushback. Your best player getting injured on a questionable play; no physical retribution; getting shutout - pick 2.	25
14282	Nope. I don't think so either. Same thing I noticed with a couple of accounts that posted here at ESS recently.	10
66497	From one non compliant roster to another	27
65385	The Patriots dethroned the Rams and the greatest show on turf, it'd be cool for the Rams to do the same now.	23
133603	You know what I love abou you [NAME]? Octopussy. Man, I must have seen that movie... twice.	7
67635	Welp. That sucks. I always check left and right when crossing an intersection, getting T-boned is one of my biggest fears.	9
180986	It looks like it may be some type of munchkin cat since it has short legs	7

45841	Nice melt bra	0
68525	The right had both houses and the presidency and they wait until they lose the house to pretend they care about passing wall funding. So brave.	0
207967	Her performance was absolutely awful in the Elseworlds crossover. So much so that every time she was on screen it made me cringe.	14
73516	It's just bizarre you would criticize [NAME] on his development capabilities when he's not a developer... His specialties are centered around crypto philosophy	3
95689	By far the coolest thing I've seen on this thread yet	3
145806	I like it so far I’d heard of it ages ago just never got round to watching it.	4
25068	Oh [NAME] lol the cringe is palpable	1

136463	Yeah, it’s interesting how I’ve had conversations on the overground but not the underground. 	4
16924	He also had a huge game. He was taking advantage of [NAME]. So without him this game isn’t even that close.	0

38085	this has been an issue ever since, they already know and don't seem to care	27
62624	This is not unique to [RELIGION]. There are various sects and denominations in every world religion.	27
165082	Oh there goes gravity	27
201786	He looks so young without a beard/moustache though.	27
111989	I'm glad I'm not the only one that allocates points for road kills.	15
210915	Hahaha, ok. I was worried there for a second....	1
53018	I would say you’ll be fine just drink water and maybe run/sweat a few times before your drug test!	27
168908	*Now* he wants to negotiate? We don't believe you, TЯeasonous TЯump...	27
143971	Thank you for the advice. I was thinking it was envy, and I needed some place to get advice from some strangers.	15
6994	A RACK ON IT YEEEEEE GONNA LIVE BET THAT SHIT AND SECOND HALF 3K let’s goooo	13

43270	I guarantee you it is a huge concern to him. Never let up on the pressure against fascists.	14

202430	No stairway.. Deniieed.	27
65460	Pretty old when you're 12.	0
116787	That's true for every loss except for this one. He's being really petty and hasn't taken the [NAME] loss well.	4

84538	Can't say that I do, no.	10
41504	Yes congratulations that was the joke.	15
168047	Nope! His real name starts with a G. Weird spelling of a common name, and pretty identifiable so I’ve never wanted to use it 🙃	10
16851	This just made my day! Thanks for the laugh!!	1
186517	Wasn't implying that, just weird that a South African brand is so popular overseas all things considered.	27
33502	Sub... chill... I see what you did there...	4
35949	Damn don’t sell this	2
85115	And todsy the crips are up 3 points narrowly beating out the bloods who only rose 2.5.	27
102933	They're cowards.	27
199714	This has been my dream for years!!!	8
9021	yeah my face goes numb in 20 degrees and lower windchill, I can't even imagine how I would feel in that!	6
11823	He's really likeable but has some flaws. I hope I'm wrong but i don't see him being a phenom like [NAME]	9
21865	Been saying horford has been overrated since he got that fat contract	13
138837	My tongue is still a little scorched lol. But totally worth it	1
5167	It’s so hard to be a mommy! Chasing kiddos. Work, work, work!!! 	9
187482	I drive for a living so I have a pretty high-end camera that captures license plates!	17
113003	You have to be REALLY old to be too old to appreciate rap music. Rap music started in the 1970s.	27
54998	it's basically a mock selective exam	1
118396	I don't like it, simply because men never want to be just friends, and I have no interest in dating random dudes who message me.	10
60638	The city would have that removed so quickly to keep the cash cow mooing.	27
128183	I thought the sane until I got threatening emails from HR	22
15771	Polls are closing now! If you're waiting to vote, stay in line! Results should be in shortly!	27
31130	You're the reason [NAME] won the election. There isn't anything even remotely resembling fascism in the United States. Get a grip.	3
94936	Having long good chats with brother about stuff, got clear boundaries set, thanks all	15
39125	It's bad enough when the Jocasta syndrome is one-sided. This is a pile of yikes.	26
104552	You know what’s ignorant? People who spend their free time making themselves look like a belligerent, disputatious assholes. Find something better to do. 	7

126488	It was good of you to get him out of the store as quickly as possible so he could not infect you with his crazy.	0
85437	[NAME]. Gave up in October and haven’t looked back. I can’t believe how easy I’ve found it.	4
176911	My favourite is when [NAME] was getting ready to be taken out of her house, but she had to have a bowl of Froot Loops first.	0
5759	I never knew that existed. I'm bloody dying right now 😂	1
145210	All these threads are being brigaded hard. They're not even trying to hide it.	27
108945	Yep. The problem is definitely regulation and not wealth hoarding supported by corporate money controlling politics. Temporarily embarrassed millionaires unite!	12
124698	Been scoring big on the Groudons.. caught 4 so far. Edit: no, no shinys yet. I've had the worst luck with shinys in this game	0

108086	Imagine being upset over who someone loves.	25
61595	[NAME] is freaking adorable fight me	27
75063	I figured as much. If I were them I'd definitely be sceptical.	22
5854	This happened to me 6 months ago and I am still hurt and actively trying to talk to her... Idk how to stop	6
115591	Why are we trusting them to do anything after messing it up that badly?	27
111354	Teachers, do not diddle these kids!	27
69788	[NAME] can’t space and [NAME] is getting worse defensively	11
77667	I'd be ok with [NAME] if it guaranteed we were firing [NAME]	27
91557	"""Chicken"" out "	27
86153	I feel like the world just doesn’t want [NAME] to have the spotlight. This is torture for a [NAME] fan like me. :’(	27

117473	chippy chippy ball	27
8579	I was there on the opposite side of the field. I did not believe he made that catch until we saw it later on tv. Unreal.	0
187173	No, I mean that each single individual will commonly use contradictory arguments just to satisfy his comment-du-jour. Everyone but incels realizes it.	27
125953	Oh, true 	4
24947	I won't even reply anymore. That radio silence mid convo really gets on my nerves.	27
89266	I'm full of envy. Would love to be on that sort of money! But I fail to see the problem with it.	18
139022	You're attractive. I would shag you. Worcester isn't too far from Derbyshire haha	0
49940	It could also be that coupledom is the wrong way to live for OP.	27
149112	I'm glad you managed to find your own fun and most probably made a big contribution for this great ending. The whole masked rogue idea was amazing	0
160148	How did such a veteran make such a rookie mistake	6
191250	The best advice I have, which it seems most people completely overlook: Have fun.	4
22600	Now that u mention it, its bugging me too...	3
16947	I made one comment, and you came in to call it childish..... like, what else are you doing besides badgering?	27
146779	Oh, he was so wronged in ME3.	27
174037	Organs are literal superfoods and it weirds me out there hasn't been some fad diet with them yet.	3
56492	Oh really?	26
65058	[NAME] damn fruit booters.	3
136954	Well if they are in the playoffs it likely means we are not so that should be a cause for concern regardless of how they perform once they get there	27

102312	Wtf is this lmao god I hate reddit	2
92021	As a Jeep driver, I constantly have to remind other Jeep drivers that 4WD/AWD only makes a difference when driving. Everyone has 4-wheel stop.	27
13422	I use 3 different credit unions and all of them are great. Used Wells Fargo for a short while and hated them.	0
81857	It's even worse when you get someone from NJ who has no clue how to drive in the city environment.	6
36974	As a [NAME] this makes me proud.	21
136234	He specifically called t a “commitment” rather than a plan. Commitment means they told tulo he is the shortstop.	4
45280	Well I am a lady, so that would probably just freak them out. Oh, Reddit. Everyone is a man haha. 	10
209400	"That's a very long way of saying ""I'm a moron"" "	27

44876	You gotta work on you dude!! If you're not confident you're not ready, get yourself straight And all will fall into place. 	5
125317	Interesting that despite not having absolute views you are absolutely all over here pushing the view it's [NAME] that's the problem	7
136682	At least if you don't have the body, you've got the sense of humour. So I can rule you out or is it a possibility lol	7
124541	Sorry dude. I’m pretty new here. Wasn’t sure I had to do that. My bad. 😢	6
98597	At this point I am questioning your sanity, you compare a guy with 40/34 goal seasons to a kid who literally can't hit the net	10
164168	and now i went there...and got ragey and stabby LOL wtaf is wrong with people?! obviously, rhetorical question...but wtaf	27

93834	Bore off, you pearl-clutching, centerist coward. 	27

34526	Woops. I'll keep it that way. Never be tired AF and post on reddit y'all.	9
185833	You are entitled to live your life the way you want to. I never said you weren't. You really are just disappointing.	9

164025	And what’s your thoughts on that specific scenario? Now I’m curious.	7
32480	[NAME] being 50-33 against winning teams kinda suggests it wouldn't matter that much if their division were better. Maybe have gone to 7 superbowls instead of 8.	6

190514	So word is we have eyes on [NAME]... I would be pretty amped to see him with a Jet on his shirt.	27
208164	don't we all hate them?	2
205825	It also would have to take less than like 2 hours for me to get to my destination, time is worth more to me than real money ya know	4
78798	Ah, I remember you. You were mentioned on this subreddit before as a magnificent player.	27
3741	That'll teach 'em. I bet they won't do that again!	27
105364	Well that didn't take long, sorry for your loss :(	25

190851	I feel that this happens to the entire cast it any major reality show.	27

185598	Well that’s dumb. The question is about this sub.	3
113342	I’m an NA boy and Rival/Dig were my two favorite orgs. Glad to see at least one of them is returning.	15
174688	I remember writing on them was horrible. Slight delay which threw me off combined with the letters ending up looking like crap. Whiteboard was so much easier.	14

159805	Being too scared of calling someone isn’t a disability for fuck sakes... use some common sense and grow up.	27
137642	It honestly sounds like he has some type of addiction to games. Reminds me a lot of my ex.	4
134809	lol reddit is for 10 year olds confirmed	1
45167	Because it’s more fun?	17
64959	Have fun!	5
109393	It was never implied as such. You simply mistakenly interpreted it that way.	9
96038	Oh gosh that's no good! Perhaps the other options are better places to start	26
146331	thats.... not the type of disco that i remember	6
12961	[NAME] and [NAME] have a strange relationship, I can see them teaming up to go to Kings landing for vengeance together.	27
12248	Is this the track that’s just [NAME] cat meowing but slowed down? My memory is failing me	6
44644	They spam that stuff because its working. Make them stop it .. and punish them.	2
81055	No, you said you think she deserves whatever she can afford. Can she afford housing?	6
170831	Have either of you or anyone else in your newsroom faced personal threats because of your work on this project?	27
200616	That head pat and hug was the physical equivalent of “oh my sweet summer child.”	4
194985	"""I'm here for the strings"" I like this."	27
145220	The school should make a list of sexual assaulters. The boys who engage in this should be shamed publicly.	12
140159	maybe they need Congress to pass a bill to make the music softer than the dialogue	6
196012	I hope we actually dont need to wait like 1 year for this. :(	20
160141	Ahh damn, keep in mind that the pillars move in the direction of the side you’re on, it’s lowkey finnicky	27
81300	[NAME] - Holdin on. Check out his music because he is honestly amazing.	0
168133	Seriously we haven't gotten a stop barely at all tonight.	27
106690	"""oh that wasn't me, my baby brother must have grabbed my phone"" "	7
27790	Thanks for recording a video message with AntiRivet like 3 years ago for me. Hope everything is going well.	15
110770	Hahaha exactly, and deciding on even the most simple of things	27
183493	Thanks for giving advice to the people who need it 👌🙏	15
148524	It's just an edgy 12 year old's creation.	4
132618	[NAME] looks great	15
101495	Nah eats the heads when he’s finished with them. I punt them so I can buy fresh meat.	3
38467	Monument to stupidity more like.	2
11569	I'm sorry you had a bad experience, that's horrible. But that number saved one of my friends lives. Different for everyone	14
10546	I. AM. AWARE. That doesn't make it cool and good for him to race bait.	0
45730	Don’t do a long distance thing, not worth it and a waste of time	5
160892	Fly, you fool!	1
51388	Maybe if you live in America.	27
101547	Yeah weird feelings too	4
165856	So word is we have eyes on [NAME]... I would be pretty amped to see him with a Jet on his shirt.	13
44523	I would love a lineup of [NAME], [NAME] he can play [NAME]), and [NAME].	4
68148	He aged twenty years with that look.	9
209661	Thank you for that link, ended up finally having a nice quote to make as a flair	15
19946	I think [NAME] would guard his butt but [NAME] would try dropping 50 on his head.	27
48464	You didnt!	27
155670	They will get the other. It's all fun and games until they noticed I was friends with a deep trust issues with humans since they were little.	9
164621	That’s ridiculous. I’ll read it, thanks.	15
207531	"Yes, and when I do say ""no"" I'm filled with tremendous guilt. "	24
26560	[NAME] book? What the heck?!	2
11689	Mono Red is probably the best counter to Mono Blue, but it is unfavored vs Ramp and that probably makes it a bad choice.	9
120236	Everyone is reporting about it on TV. Was cool to see the highlight.	4
200379	So many questions unanswered. Poor guy.	27
144057	Air traffic controllers are responsible for 100,000x the amount of lives. Should they be getting paid more? I'm not sure this is the best argument to make. 	0
99063	You: I'm an athiest [NAME]: idc	27
194168	Oh [NAME], dont talk about clippers!	27
209464	So is the OP still permabanned for no reason?	7
157618	Did [NAME] funnel money to any paramilitaries?	27
129829	*[NAME] loved that*	17
5503	He's mainly on Twitch now. Before I unfollowed him some time ago he did some YT content from time to time.	4
61524	Now you’re reddit staking me? Don’t comment on my stuff dude.. gtfoh	3
183048	Tbh I love [NAME] but for [NAME] id be willing to see him go. [NAME] gives [NAME] the best chance he'll ever have of competing.	27
21535	Wasn't that just a mass shooting? Or am I thinking of another college massacre?	27
205896	Please don’t marry this man-child.	27
21673	I thought [NAME] trained her after the boxing was over?	6
196672	I hate to say it, but it's never once failed me, I've never been asked to show it.	22
147903	I wouldn't mind seeing a discussion with her and [NAME] about their experiences being millennials in Congress. Just having AOC doesn't interest me at all.	27
105166	Annnnd that's too far. I think you should go home and rethink your life.	5
159726	"Is there such thing as ""only a cat""?"	27
124231	I love how you are a individual just trying to be yourself. I always say sexuality is the least interesting things about yourself.	4
89773	Woah nice. Did you enjoy it or was it a completionist pain? I wish I could get into [NAME] but I just dont find the fun.	0
154662	Now if you can teach her english, the real fun starts. 	27
46055	I realised after I typed it, but I left it up. I feel sometimes in life, you just gotta take the L. 	22
209470	What does scalp mean?	27
45309	This is the proper timing	4
87359	So is that like your opinion or a viewpoint you can back up with solid reasoning?	7
166566	i get the joke and still think this sucks.	6
143424	Does this remind anyone else of the Rublev USO17 QF? [NAME] is obviously further along than [NAME] but you can't argue against the results...	3
151918	Sounds hella aggressive. You can say the same thing while being nicer about it.	3
93896	As an [NAME], I apologize for the cranky old conservatives who are probably making ridiculously uninformed comments about your country right now :/	12
54299	I feel that nobody cares and nothing will be different because this is a total non issue for vast majority of people.	9
920	Tbh bastion is still super op before it now I can just abuse him more	11
191107	Yeah you are second. Time to move on lol	1
58163	Your personality comes off as really obnoxious and overbearing. Maybe your thinly-veiled desperation explains why she didn’t want to go out with you.	27
147557	IM GONNA PASS OUT	13
5498	Can´t believe the problem was this. Thx mate, it´s solved!	10
48344	I honestly loved her performance as [NAME] in Scott Pilgrim. But then again I also love Scott Pilgrim so...	0
11863	>You're worth a lot more than that and there are so many other impressive and interesting things about you. What an outrageous lie.	0
55092	I wish they would put dfs in for [NAME] right now	8
13011	She is too	4
52193	Ohhh, thank you for enlightening me 😂😂	4
164208	Thank you. So many people out there that would rather be right and in a grave than swallow their pride and do the safer thing.	5
104058	It makes me mad when people steal them lol... chances are if you're nice I'll just *give* it to you	1
12503	Fuuuck, brutal	2
178585	Oh good! Yeah hard to pick up on sarcasm sometimes	0
137465	For some reason I can't reply to [NAME], but also for the neysayers:	27
106755	you don’t appreciate the good times till you go through the bad.. things will get better OP, stay strong	9
150956	[NAME] is [NAME].	4
7975	I like simplicity of the Jersey, but the logo stinks.	0
7756	There's really no need to test for congenital defects with a mixed breed.	10
188063	I love Invader Zim.	18
29092	Wow. He might actually lose Iowa	22
53639	Umm... I do it everyday since I was 13 and I’m fine... could be just me...	6
175768	I think its his brother ?	4
29424	Is she talking about his dickee?	7
152626	im sorry for your loss. your aunts behavior is disgusting. dont give her anything.	2
185976	All sound advice. I still hate the ult when it kills me by a small hair.	27
179775	Steakspeare in Love	18
143993	You’re on thin fucking ice, buddy	27
95997	Maybe work on being a little more optimistic for the future......don't be a debbie downer! :)	10
84587	That’s what they said when the provincial election for Ontario happened too Then [NAME] begged on tv, that low life. Good luck! 	20
153298	Right there with you. 20 years together and suddenly its over. I'm tired of crying and hurting. We'll get through this.	25
41237	I’m so sorry the internet has inconvenienced you	24
99766	try to attract the guy that i like. other than that i love gaming drawing writing and watching tv.	8
209120	There can be, but I meant the consequences of murdering someone in broad daylight.	27
36730	This really bothers me too. I completely agree. It would have helped us avoid a US situation. Now I think we're barreling toward it	4
32366	Lmk if you do this shirts hilarious and I kind of want one	27
150430	When it goes bad	6
163351	Why is sleeping with a coworker such a big problem for a news network? It’s not the military with a rank disparity or something	3
183256	Write her a hand written letter and go back and deliver that to her damned door.	27
186615	Franchise QB's are leaders who set the tone for the entire lockerroom. [NAME] is a terrible leader.	27

94926	Love how he stops and embraces the pole.	12
49227	It’s amazing what can happen when they get a good nights sleep	0
56000	Everyone is a little toxic inside. I feel like killers being toxic comes from survivors being toxic and vice versa. It's a vicious cycle.	25
205459	Is that a TV or a computer monitor ? :O	6
10930	[NAME] can be my friend!	8

76344	Good advice right here and good things to think about.	4
173029	I've found out speaking about our traumas is what heals us. Some people also need to hear our struggles to overcome theirs.	27
172088	I think we should conduct a study and find out, otherwise I don’t know and you don’t either	22
84367	We try too, but more often than not those who wish to discuss are not on the level, rare is a Lib here in good faith.	27

154840	Thanks! That was an interesting read. Seems there really is a city where they built more homes than there were people to live there!	15
93875	Let's us both hope you will be losing it come by the end of the September then... LOL It would be freaking awesome if it happens.	0
176277	I am sports entertained.	0
201838	Well thanks. Digital currency is one thing I personally havent gotten into yet.	15

152192	But if you go to fredmeyer, which is also Kroger, It's like 50% cheaper on most things. lol.	1
83429	Have to love Billy's commitment. Absolutely hilarious.	1
4081	Lies, damn lies and statistics. 	2
161426	You dodged a bullet. She sounds like she's easily manipulated and they're nightmare in laws. Bad combo	4
191961	"Okay fine. Still though. Make some joke ""maybe we should cuddle for warmth"" and see how she responds. "	7
100587	That's the key- minor corrections, little improvements, something slightly different.	5
201376	Thank you! Forgot to add her youtube. And her second, smaller, channels (super entertaining rants): 	15
173090	your joke sucks	3
42808	I wish to join you on the search, as a source of motivation and friendship (sorry if that kinds led you on)	5
17097	[NAME] and a libertarian? Is that some post-modern BS like a person can be a man and a woman at the same time?	27
131464	Yeah, there are trees that are far older than 521 years.	4
168901	The [NAME] trade to get [NAME] wasn't too shabby either.	22
133261	It certainly reeks of the same kind of scam.	3
204132	Brother, we've been separated.	27
98753	I believe that show scared straight was actually a massive failure, it got viewers but concept of it never resulted in the kids actually being 'scared straight'.	14
120750	Not looking for anything serious ≠ rejection	4
121695	Found the selfish and shitty anti-vaxxer in the thread. How many of us have to die before you get your fucking kids vaccinated?	2
55490	I honestly do not know. Chastise them for their hardness of heart and presumptiveness I suppose. I guess that is what [NAME] would do.	3
94116	My Ping Pong Queen looks so happy! I cried lol	17
189579	I've been pinched a couple times by it's tiny brothers, would not recommend holding that! Damn! It's cute tho. 	27
152193	[NAME] they need a union so badly.	3
134932	"Don't debate is probably the worst advice one can give. It's like saying: ""obey blindly. Don't question us."""	10
126035	I have stated from the beginning that I do not believe that Abuse, Interrupted is a good resource for people in this subreddit.	22
98927	I’m okay with the “expecting mother’s” spots. It’s not a women thing, it’s a courtesy thing 	5
2544	[NAME] just got to slide into Chef Bois DMs	27
133952	Then let’s keep scrolling and posting to push this thread to the bottom - let them waste their time on someone who is absolutely irrelevant at best.	4
168666	"Welp, my bad. Searched for ""new year"" and didn't see this so posted."	9
17245	It’s pretty cringe	14
150040	Woo! New sci fi! Thanks!	0
202153	This is pretty funny	1
75293	I won't cry any crocodile pears for you, that's for sure.	4
130434	Turn undead is once per short rest, you can’t make use of it frequently, no wonder the dm was frustrated	3
139368	What does adderrall do that makes you lose weight? Appetite suppressant?	7
104888	Exactly, you need a Hollywood woman of age to pair off with him. Past 35 should be fine right?	4
675	Im sure you’ll love it	4
200656	Hes literally making 15 an hour	11
110116	Until he leaves for the Lakers and we’re right back in the same spot in two years after not winning shit	2

51085	[NAME] can stuff it, but I’ll take the disengagement from the Administration for what it is.	4
93841	I want this feature just so I can get rid of the nasty rugged beige skins people have on their guns	8
26444	It doesn't have to be illegal to be wrong. And really, *sit down*? lol	27
49043	I’m in one of those schools now got offered weed yesterday almost bullied into smoking	27
79022	She’s such a moron	27
24179	Yeah lol, my bad. 	1
78200	I hate that this is true. Some of these offices are such a pain to find and cash tips are never part of the equation	3
159733	Of course not.	10
28602	The projectiles are 1L bottles, so more cylinders than spheres. Does it make any difference? 	7
22777	Oh dear. Yah, start with the criminal lawyer then - custody won’t be an issue if you’re in jail. :-/	27
1294	I was expecting the clip from Home Alone that [NAME] uses to scare the burglars (I think it's from Angels With Filthy Souls).	7
31447	I love this sub	4
19674	Nice ovation when he first checked in and after the tribute video. Also made some noise when he hit a 3 late.	4
83406	Those types of retirement homes are for people that want to live in a social community. But you are right, find another community. 	3
210743	"It's okay. Just tell them you meant I love you ""two"" twice for four."	18
87165	WHAT that's heresy - how can you get BTS and EXO mixed up 🤣 Although I would die if they collabed! Can you imagine [NAME] rapping with [NAME] 😍	17
172019	Or finishing in 91 minutes and sitting there for another half hour, bursting for a piss	27
161297	🤷🏻‍♀️ As a wise man once said: he was a bastard in life thus a bastard in death 	2
26852	Holy crap, I've never seen a picture of [NAME] so thin.	26
171487	I just don't know whether to believe if this is achieveable at this age.	6
32410	[NAME] has become the best houseguest ever in 24 hours. We aren’t worthy	0
166125	Get his master class. My boyfriend watched it and he got obsessed with cooking, knife techniques, etc. (for like 3 months).	27
4646	I had an ex like that. I know why I couldn't function with his way of life. Totally unproductive.	26
94853	Weird how the cops can pick and choose which laws to enforce and when, but I guess that explains a lot.	1
206086	United wins the championship and then profits 20 million off this transfer? Rest of the MLS needs to take notes and catch up	7
188082	> Do you need me to link posts or something? Yep. Nice ban evasion account, by the way. 	0
132599	I haven't had mine in years thanks to [NAME]	27
60102	Dude you’re honestly unhinged. I think you need a break from the internet for today... it’ll do you some good.	5
11797	You mean morons??	7
127496	Agreed but I’ll still take kpins if they’re available	4
38796	Think you need more gin with it and you will be alright next time	27
84263	Currently sure, but the idea is to have a group of educated [NAME] ready to steer the inevitable civil unrest that Capitalism will bring, towards Socialism.	27
127215	I provoked by breathing too hard. And yes, I hate that. 	2
210540	You gotta work on you dude!! If you're not confident you're not ready, get yourself straight And all will fall into place. 	5
28079	Some are still thinking what's going on😂😂	6
47298	Her elitism is what earned her the place here. She's clearly a lefty statist.	0
161127	Why people talk about their prior sex lives is beyond me. There is no upside to doing that, and plenty of downside.	27
73024	[NAME] was such a disaster at OC, I really don't feel comfortable even implying he's in Schotty's league.	9
196753	Still won the race though ha who’s a failure now	0
44160	Wee bit touchy..	27
163336	I'm a parent and am telling you that dude is sad and insecure as fuck.	4

149695	Prepare for trouble, and make it double	1
154220	[NAME] in the Lego movie? Get outta here	2
19596	Good luck! If you do need to get her, you just gotta fuse together a Bicorn and a Jack Frost.	20
198814	I guess that depends on the department. If you've racked up a ton of vacay time, it's possible for some cops to smoke weed lol.	27
55543	Imagine your daughter running away from home. I think that's a pretty terrifying idea without some murderer or mystic horror	14
10989	Back in my day the only bars you could find were real ones👴	4
20682	Shamelessly stolen from	3
95302	I don’t get why he hasn’t brought his insta account back, he did used to use it from time to time	9
111181	Definitely not. It would be so boring to have no chance year after year.	10
40939	Game of the conference season so far and ESPN screws up the stream with only a link to the game in Spanish?	27
164173	That is interesting. Can you site some sources or anything on this matter ? I am genuinely intrigued .	0
95740	Constantly worrying about her and not feeling pleasure without her presence could be. You need to talk to a therapist.	27
47827	Cheers mate for the correction, i saw Prestigeiskey's vid and couldnt remember exactly when but knew its coming sooner than later. 	20
11721	[NAME] get your racial and gender slurs straight!	27

75686	If we trade him I don’t think be will be a playoff team :(	9
40895	It's interesting that they don't know to take the handset off the hook before dialing.	1
85993	holy shit I got mad at those 4 points you made [NAME], playing [NAME] like that would be literally hell.	2
96208	Lots of community theaters have great programs. What part of the valley are you in?	6
77835	It's just you. Nobody has ever noticed. Except this and [this person.	13
203198	> Origin Peak is a volcanic island less than 2000 years old! Volcanoes can appear VERY quickly...	27
46972	“Touch me again and I’ll kill you.” I’m low key blown away that The Last Boy Scout even *made* it to Australia.	27
202571	But it saved people with even more money lots of money. The owners of the teams.	17
33466	I’m okay with the “expecting mother’s” spots. It’s not a women thing, it’s a courtesy thing 	27
157909	I'm puzzled	6
112484	Knife Fight used to be an awesome cooking comp show	27
124461	Too fast for me in the chat room. I'm on my phone and can't type that fast. Here is more relaxed and everyone is hilarious.	1
156457	The last thing you see before entering Hell.	27
171905	I have completely lost my voice this period. This has been an insane 11 minutes of play	4
120742	It's like a before and after of a stock market crash with a dodgy investment manager.	4
182803	Only in portland	27
119340	I also remember the scripts stating [NAME] look was one of jealousy, which disappoints me.	9
153725	Thanks, saved. Will watch it tomorrow morning :) 	15
137278	1-2-3-4 I declare a thumb war! Dangit [NAME], you win again! Ok you get to stab me again :(	25
110206	Was hilarious. RIP Roman	1
174244	There are no helpful ideas like the one you're looking for. There is only one idea... Tell your parents and get authorities involved.	14
91584	Wow. AP should find that video and flag whoever did that...deep, scary issues at play	22
65984	I’m picking up my fourth one tomorrow. CZ Scorpion Evo 3 .... and I’m stoked	13
203594	Weird combinaison of letters for french poeple	11
168647	It's interesting that [NAME] said [NAME] was his teacher on playing doomfist. Actually in mid 2017 [NAME] was one of, if not the best doomfist in China	27
108349	HEY! Once I was out on my own, I **loved** getting socks and underwear as gifts. My son just realized the same thing.	18

87098	Communism is 100x worse than muh evil nazis. Commies need the whole world to follow their ideology and even then it would not work.	22
127693	You’re a women hating racist. That’s what you are. Stop talking shite and trying to pretend otherwise	9
104658	Currently have 2 points. One is from when my cat died and the other is from a really bad migraine.	27
10693	Great album! 👊	0
99569	I’d say this is spot on. He’s not sorry he hurt me. He just wants me to shut up.	27
195226	Nothing matters. The world was burning when you came in to it and it will be burning when you leave it.	20
20349	Erm... Maybe he wants you to use those toys... On him.	27
121072	Reminds of kissing my first girlfriend. [NAME], we had no idea what we were doing. 	6
88020	it's funny how conservatives always say that leftists get angry over everything when conservatives get angry over a starbucks cup or a brown man existing	1
179241	Wow amazing gift you have there being able to tell who someone voted for just because they were rude	0
110551	Right but even without the FPTA surely we could have found ourselves in the same situation from a legal perspective?	7
85366	Ahhh, that was actually really peaceful and cathartic. 	4
133202	Damn, this one sucks doubly so considering all the positive threads on here today.	9
73791	I mean, is that really a guilty pleasure? It sounds like the coolest thing I have ever heard. 	4
205519	The first story in the history of humanity.	13
178492	I was like you man, 3 felt so bad. But street part 4 3 becomes a so bad it's hilarious imo.	9
206712	> [NAME] That is going to get sooo confusing if he does join our division.	6

16926	We are doomed	9
39171	:). Can you post your percentages tho, I am curious. 	0
90963	Mind boggling. Truly. This is the same deal SHE negotiated. Why didn't she find out if her party would back it BEFORE she signed it?	0
138277	Refusing to pay someone for work that they've done is theft. You can try to justify it any way you want but that's what it is.	10
131103	My point was they had no choice but to pull social levers to try and improve health, as they didn't have anything else at their disposal. 	27
117201	Purdue's worst loss is Notre Dame (93 Kenpom) New Mexico is 187 in Kenpom. Good try tho	0
119302	Took devils -1.5. Gotta love sports betting in Jersey.	18
163838	Games like this are just demoralizing for our players.	3

205729	By [NAME]! That’s [NAME] music!	22
128209	IT'S MA'AM!!!	27
89754	That's true. People feel they can't trust anything so they just chose to believe what they want to believe.	4
87968	Plus the idea of a choose your own adventure movie is absolutely exciting and brings more chances to go back through	13
7062	He's rolled his eyes at least 3 or 4 times by now.	27

100507	Man, I wish I liked music that much. Well maybe not *that* much, but you know what I mean. 	27

134833	Whaaat. I liked Season 8 [NAME]. I wish the whole love arc between him and [NAME] had never been a thing, but I liked [NAME]. 	18
47717	I think thats dumb and simplistic. You really can't boil down the sociology of race by comparing it to 2+2=4.	10
61998	Maybe even prettier!	27
54753	Imagine this spreading big time, pressuring them into opening the stadium against us so they don’t look like cowards, only for us to thrash them again	27
131883	I really hope [NAME] or [NAME] or somebody from the show sees this 😂	27
119251	Also assumes a kid only has one teacher K-12 at school. Which is ridiculous.	3

168573	Have to stay positive! I AM getting a new job I love in the field I want to work in!	13

44785	this definitely fits in r/BoneAppleTea.	27
206626	Well one of our leading candidates is [NAME] so it's not like we're killing it in our search either	3
153406	[NAME] finally getting WCW going I see..	13

179545	Degloved finger...*ouch*. One of the worst types of avulsions.	3
15284	I'd say the pecans is the biggest mistake	3

75580	Yeah I should have said ‘wouldn’t it be ironic’	9
15891	He’s down at least one pair of glasses, if not an eyesocket as well. 	27
118212	Me neither. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Freaky mind of mine!	26
33838	I had 3 last night 🙈 this rant was after glass #1	27
38476	Why did she get married if she did not love him? Aren't you afraid the same thing wil happen to you?	7
180093	That's like if she went up to your car and removed your bumper stickers because she doesn't want them in her pictures.	27
172500	It honestly sounds like he has some type of addiction to games. Reminds me a lot of my ex.	27
194492	My bad! It looked so real XD thanks for the heads up	3
203261	He's practicing difficult shots too much thus loosing a feeling for easy ones.....	20

32605	You've been salty since we beat y'all. That's just how mafia works my friend.	11

151102	That’s what everyone seems to be saying	27
71843	I'm worried he choked to death before he could finish the sentence.	16
104772	That's pretty good all things considered, if they want to maintain that, they really need to get a patch out ASAP	0
84057	No compromise, the Democrats are finally showing some goddamn backbone. 	2

151161	Let’s just start with the reason of why you left [RELIGION].	27
32317	Maybe it depends on the state. In California, that means you’re a moderate [NAME].	27
185176	[NAME] might actually be able to pick her up and carry her without huffing and puffing now? 😳😓	27

186396	"Ahhh a fellow atheist, I used that in the standard social meaning but no intention of meaning ""god"" would actually bless you lol but thx "	1

183790	Thanks a lot, [NAME]. Now I've lost my train of thought!	15
154699	I can't imagine how scary that was for you. What is wrong with people?	3

189941	Thank you for your advice! I really do appreciate it and will implement it as the kids get older.	4
61898	You should re-think the credibility of whoever told you otherwise. Seems snarky to me.	4
31596	Just leave already	27

5732	are they clean, though? the chlorine keeps it clean, to my understanding.	7
42204	This offseason has been so upsetting	27

151771	Kinda like how he wants to “out” kids?	6
74260	I wholeheartedly agree with you. I suspect that children this age don't quite understand this	4
22454	They are looking pretty stacked this year	27
29061	Just do it. Straight up ask if he wants to date in clear terms. If he doesn't no reason you can't stay friends.	10

30625	So where are all these [NAME] lining up to be landscapers and farmhands for minimum wage?	27

150671	If they are suffering immense pain, I doubt watching Endgame is high on their list of priorities	6
136804	[NAME] literally did nothing and got a foul called lmao	27
52444	[NAME], you're back! And still posting the same old editorialized political garbage, I see. Some things never change.	22

208228	As if the sweet release of death is *worse* than getting stuck behind some idiot	27

172628	That's exactly what it was modelled on, MTV show as well. The pun was just begging to made so they did 	27
67122	[NAME] first event was IW, not last year. So you're comparing his second year playing professionals on LAN vs Cells first time. 	27
199027	/u/allegedlynerdy is referring to China not Russia, as obviously Russia is not “religion free,” but atheist China is still very homophobic.	4
